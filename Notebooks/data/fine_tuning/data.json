There are three types of color mixing: additive, subtractive, and average. In first two cases, mixing is typically described in terms of three primary colors and three secondary colors (colors made by mixing two of the three primary colors in equal amounts). Subtractive mixing with all three primaries will result in black, while additive mixing with all three primaries will result in white. ==Additive mixing== thumb|A simulated example of additive color mixing. Additive primaries act as sources of light. The primaries red, green, and blue combine pairwise to produce the additive secondaries cyan, magenta, and yellow. Combining all three primaries (center) produces white. The additive mixing of colors is not commonly taught to children, as it does not correspond to the mixing of physical substances (such as paint) which would correspond to subtractive mixing. Two beams of light that are superimposed mix their colors additively. By convention, the three primary colors in additive mixing are red, green, and blue. In the absence of light of any color, the result is black. If all three primary colors of light are mixed in equal proportions, the result is neutral (gray or white). When the red and green lights mix, the result is yellow. When green and blue lights mix, the result is cyan. When the blue and red lights mix, the result is magenta. Red-green–blue additive mixing is used in television and computer monitors, including smartphone displays, to produce a wide range of colors. A screen pixel uses a juxtaposition of these three primary colors. Projection televisions sometimes have three projectors, one for each primary color. ==Subtractive mixing== thumb|right|A simulated example of (idealized) subtractive color mixing. An external source of\n\nID: 1\nTitle: RGB color model\nContent: human eye; good primaries are stimuli that maximize the difference between the responses of the cone cells of the human retina to light of different wavelengths, and that thereby make a large color triangle. The normal three kinds of light-sensitive photoreceptor cells in the human eye (cone cells) respond most to yellow (long wavelength or L), green (medium or M), and violet (short or S) light (peak wavelengths near 570 nm, 540 nm and 440 nm, respectively). The difference in the signals received from the three kinds allows the brain to differentiate a wide gamut of different colors, while being most sensitive (overall) to yellowish-green light and to differences between hues in the green-to-orange region. As an example, suppose that light in the orange range of wavelengths (approximately 577 nm to 597 nm) enters the eye and strikes the retina. Light of these wavelengths would activate both the medium and long wavelength cones of the retina, but not equally—the long-wavelength cells will respond more. The difference in the response can be detected by the brain, and this difference is the basis of our perception of orange. Thus, the orange appearance of an object results from light from the object entering our eye and stimulating the different cones simultaneously but to different degrees. Use of the three primary colors is not sufficient to reproduce all colors; only colors within the color triangle defined by the chromaticities of the primaries can be reproduced by additive mixing of non-negative amounts of those colors of light. ==History of RGB color model theory and usage== The RGB color model is based on the Young–Helmholtz theory of trichromatic color vision, developed by Thomas Young and Hermann von Helmholtz in the early to mid-nineteenth century, and on James\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Complementary colors\nContent: and blue, yellow and violet, and green and \"a purple close to scarlet\".John Gage, Couleur et culture, pg. 172. In the following decades, scientists refined Newton's color circle, eventually giving it twelve colors: the three primary colors (yellow, blue, and red); three secondary colors (green, purple and orange), made by combining primary colors; and six additional tertiary colors, made by combining the primary and secondary colors. In two reports read before the Royal Society (London) in 1794, the American-born British scientist Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford (1753–1814), coined the term complement to describe two colors that, when mixed, produce white. While conducting photometric experiments on factory lighting in Munich, Thompson noticed that an \"imaginary\" blue color was produced in the shadow of yellow candlelight illuminated by skylight, an effect that he reproduced in other colors by means of tinted glasses and pigmented surfaces. He theorized that \"To every color, without exception, whatever may be its hue or shade, or however it may be compounded, there is another in perfect harmony to it, which is its complement, and may be said to be its companion.\" He also suggested some possible practical uses of this discovery. \"By experiments of this kind, which might easily be made, ladies may choose ribbons for their gowns, or those who furnish rooms may arrange their colors upon principles of the most perfect harmony and of the purest taste. The advantages that painters might derive from a knowledge of these principles of the harmony of colors are too obvious to require illustration.\"Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, Conjectures respecting the Principle of the Harmony of Colors, The Complete Works of Count Rumford, Volume 5, pp. 67–68. (Google Books). In the early 19th century, scientists and philosophers across Europe began\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Red\nContent: vegetation. This may have driven further adaptations by species taking advantage of this new ability, such as the emergence of red faces. Red light is used to help adapt night vision in low-light or night time, as the rod cells in the human eye are not sensitive to red. === In color theory and on a computer screen === In the RYB color model, which is the basis of traditional color theory, red is one of the three primary colors, along with blue and yellow. Painters in the Renaissance mixed red and blue to make violet: Cennino Cennini, in his 15th-century manual on painting, wrote, \"If you want to make a lovely violet colour, take fine lac (red lake), ultramarine blue (the same amount of the one as of the other) with a binder\"; he noted that it could also be made by mixing blue indigo and red hematite. In the CMY and CMYK color models, red is a secondary color subtractively mixed from magenta and yellow. In the RGB color model, red, green and blue are additive primary colors. Red, green and blue light combined makes white light, and these three colors, combined in different mixtures, can produce nearly any other color. This principle is used to generate colors on such as computer monitors and televisions. For example, magenta on a computer screen is made by a similar formula to that used by Cennino Cennini in the Renaissance to make violet, but using additive colors and light instead of pigment: it is created by combining red and blue light at equal intensity on a black screen. Violet is made on a computer screen in a similar way, but with a greater amount of blue light and less red light.

In this system, magenta is the complementary color of green, and combining green and magenta light on a black screen will create white. In the CMYK color model, used in color printing, it is one of the three primary colors, along with cyan and yellow, used to print all the rest of the colors. If magenta, cyan, and yellow are printed on top of each other on a page, they make black. In this model, magenta is the complementary color of green, and these two colors have the highest contrast and the greatest harmony. If combined, green and magenta ink will look dark gray or black. The magenta used in color printing, sometimes called process magenta, is a darker shade than the color used on computer screens. In terms of physiology, the color is stimulated in the brain when the eye reports input from short wave blue cone cells along with a sub-sensitivity of the long wave cones which respond secondarily to that same deep blue color, but with little or no input from the middle wave cones. The brain interprets that combination as some hue of magenta or purple, depending on the relative strengths of the cone responses. In the Munsell color system, magenta is called red-purple. If the spectrum is wrapped to form a color wheel, magenta (additive secondary) appears midway between red and violet. Violet and red, the two components of magenta, are at opposite ends of the visible spectrum and have very different wavelengths. The additive secondary color magenta is made by combining violet and red light at equal intensity; it is not present in the spectrum itself.

The tubes were arranged with the green-filtered tube at the bottom of the chassis, facing up. Above it and to one side was the blue-filtered tube This was aimed at right angles to the green, so light from the two crossed in space between them. At the crossing point, a dichromic mirror was positioned to reflect the blue light up, while allowing the green light to pass through unchanged. Both \"beams\" were now traveling toward the top of the tube.Ed Reitan, \"RCA Laboratories Developmental Color Receivers\" , 18 January 1997 A third tube and mirror completed the system by adding red to the image. A suitable red phosphor was not available at the time; instead, a red Wratten filter was placed over a tube with bright yellow phosphor, and then neutral filtered to get the proper brightness in relation to the other two tubes. All three signals then shone onto a mirror at the top of the chassis, which reflected the light forward toward the viewer. There were numerous problems with the arrangement. The first, and most difficult to solve, was that the resulting system was enormous. One example system using three 10-inch kinescope monitors, was 40-inches high, 38-inches wide and 21-inches deep. This was the smallest of the Triniscope models produced with a reasonable display size; others had smaller chassis, but only at the cost of much smaller displays. The signal was decoded by filtering out the color portion of the signal and sending the left-over luminance signal to all three tubes evenly. The color signal was then used to gate each color tube to the correct brightness levels. This required separate circuits for each tube, and even the most developed example required a total of 44 vacuum tubes\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Shades of red\nContent: text: Varieties of the color red may differ in hue, chroma (also called saturation, intensity, or colorfulness) or lightness (or value, tone, or brightness), or in two or three of these qualities. Variations in value are also called tints and shades, a tint being a red or other hue mixed with white, a shade being mixed with black. A large selection of these various colors are shown below. ==In specific color systems== ===Red (RGB)=== Red (RGB), RGB red, or electric red (as opposed to pigment red, shown below) is the brightest possible red that can be reproduced on a computer monitor. This color is an approximation of an orangish red spectral color. It is one of the three primary colors of light in the RGB color model, along with green and blue. The three additive primaries in the RGB color system are the three colors of light chosen such as to provide the maximum gamut of colors that are capable of being represented on a computer or television set, at a reasonable expense of power. Portable devices such as mobile phones might have an even narrower gamut due to this purity–power tradeoff and their \"red\" may be less colorful and more orangish than the standard red of sRGB. This color is also the color called red in the X11 web colors, which were originally formulated in 1987. It is also called color wheel red. It is at precisely zero (360) degrees on the HSV color wheel, also known as the RGB color wheel (Image of RGB color wheel). Its complementary color is cyan. ===Red (CMYK) (pigment red)=== Pigment red is the color red that is achieved by mixing process (printer's) magenta and process (printer's) yellow in equal\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem\nContent: variables, or indices, to specify each pixel uniquely—one for the row, and one for the column. Color images typically consist of a composite of three separate grayscale images, one to represent each of the three primary colors—red, green, and blue, or RGB for short. Other colorspaces using 3-vectors for colors include HSV, CIELAB, XYZ, etc. Some colorspaces such as cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK) may represent color by four dimensions. All of these are treated as vector-valued functions over a two-dimensional sampled domain. Similar to one-dimensional discrete-time signals, images can also suffer from aliasing if the sampling resolution, or pixel density, is inadequate. For example, a digital photograph of a striped shirt with high frequencies (in other words, the distance between the stripes is small), can cause aliasing of the shirt when it is sampled by the camera's image sensor. The aliasing appears as a moiré pattern. The \"solution\" to higher sampling in the spatial domain for this case would be to move closer to the shirt, use a higher resolution sensor, or to optically blur the image before acquiring it with the sensor using an optical low-pass filter. Another example is shown to the right in the brick patterns. The top image shows the effects when the sampling theorem's condition is not satisfied. When software rescales an image (the same process that creates the thumbnail shown in the lower image) it, in effect, runs the image through a low-pass filter first and then downsamples the image to result in a smaller image that does not exhibit the moiré pattern. The top image is what happens when the image is downsampled without low-pass filtering: aliasing results. The sampling theorem applies to camera systems, where the scene\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: What are the three primary colors?\n\n[/INST]IDs: 0, 1, 3</s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

Its determination includes a chemist's specifying the molecular geometry and, when feasible and necessary, the electronic structure of the target molecule or other solid. Molecular geometry refers to the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule and the chemical bonds that hold the atoms together and can be represented using structural formulae and by molecular models; complete electronic structure descriptions include specifying the occupation of a molecule's molecular orbitals. Structure determination can be applied to a range of targets from very simple molecules (e.g., diatomic oxygen or nitrogen) to very complex ones (e.g., such as protein or DNA). ==Background== Theories of chemical structure were first developed by August Kekulé, Archibald Scott Couper, and Aleksandr Butlerov, among others, from about 1858.36th congress of the German physicians and scientists 1861 These theories were first to state that chemical compounds are not a random cluster of atoms and functional groups, but rather had a definite order defined by the valency of the atoms composing the molecule, giving the molecules a three dimensional structure that could be determined or solved. Concerning chemical structure, one has to distinguish between pure connectivity of the atoms within a molecule (chemical constitution), a description of a three-dimensional arrangement (molecular configuration, includes e.g. information on chirality) and the precise determination of bond lengths, angles and torsion angles, i.e. a full representation of the (relative) atomic coordinates. In determining structures of chemical compounds, one generally aims to obtain, first and minimally, the pattern and degree of bonding between all atoms in the molecule; when possible, one seeks the three dimensional spatial coordinates of the atoms in the molecule (or other solid). ===Structural\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Structure\nContent: atom in chemical reactions. Bonds between atoms can be represented by lines with one line for each pair of electrons that is shared. In a simplified version of such a diagram, called a skeletal formula, only carbon-carbon bonds and functional groups are shown. Atoms in a crystal have a structure that involves repetition of a basic unit called a unit cell. The atoms can be modeled as points on a lattice, and one can explore the effect of symmetry operations that include rotations about a point, reflections about a symmetry planes, and translations (movements of all the points by the same amount). Each crystal has a finite group, called the space group, of such operations that map it onto itself; there are 230 possible space groups. By Neumann's law, the symmetry of a crystal determines what physical properties, including piezoelectricity and ferromagnetism, the crystal can have. == Mathematical == == Musical == A large part of numerical analysis involves identifying and interpreting the structure of musical works. Structure can be found at the level of part of a work, the entire work, or a group of works. Elements of music such as pitch, duration and timbre combine into small elements like motifs and phrases, and these in turn combine in larger structures. Not all music (for example, that of John Cage) has a hierarchical organization, but hierarchy makes it easier for a listener to understand and remember the music. In analogy to linguistic terminology, motifs and phrases can be combined to make complete musical ideas such as sentences and phrases. A larger form is known as the period. One such form that was widely used between 1600 and 1900 has two phrases, an antecedent and a consequent, with a half cadence in the middle and\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Biomolecular structure\nContent: text: Biomolecular structure is the intricate folded, three-dimensional shape that is formed by a molecule of protein, DNA, or RNA, and that is important to its function. The structure of these molecules may be considered at any of several length scales ranging from the level of individual atoms to the relationships among entire protein subunits. This useful distinction among scales is often expressed as a decomposition of molecular structure into four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. The scaffold for this multiscale organization of the molecule arises at the secondary level, where the fundamental structural elements are the molecule's various hydrogen bonds. This leads to several recognizable domains of protein structure and nucleic acid structure, including such secondary-structure features as alpha helixes and beta sheets for proteins, and hairpin loops, bulges, and internal loops for nucleic acids. The terms primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure were introduced by Kaj Ulrik Linderstrøm-Lang in his 1951 Lane Medical Lectures at Stanford University. ==Primary structure== The primary structure of a biopolymer is the exact specification of its atomic composition and the chemical bonds connecting those atoms (including stereochemistry). For a typical unbranched, un-crosslinked biopolymer (such as a molecule of a typical intracellular protein, or of DNA or RNA), the primary structure is equivalent to specifying the sequence of its monomeric subunits, such as amino acids or nucleotides. The primary structure of a protein is reported starting from the amino N-terminus to the carboxyl C-terminus, while the primary structure of DNA or RNA molecule is known as the nucleic acid sequence reported from the 5' end to the 3' end. The nucleic acid sequence refers to the exact sequence of nucleotides that comprise the whole molecule. Often, the primary structure\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Atomic physics\nContent: text: Atomic physics is the field of physics that studies atoms as an isolated system of electrons and an atomic nucleus. Atomic physics typically refers to the study of atomic structure and the interaction between atoms. It is primarily concerned with the way in which electrons are arranged around the nucleus and the processes by which these arrangements change. This comprises ions, neutral atoms and, unless otherwise stated, it can be assumed that the term atom includes ions. The term atomic physics can be associated with nuclear power and nuclear weapons, due to the synonymous use of atomic and nuclear in standard English. Physicists distinguish between atomic physics—which deals with the atom as a system consisting of a nucleus and electrons—and nuclear physics, which studies nuclear reactions and special properties of atomic nuclei. As with many scientific fields, strict delineation can be highly contrived and atomic physics is often considered in the wider context of atomic, molecular, and optical physics. Physics research groups are usually so classified. ==Isolated atoms== Atomic physics primarily considers atoms in isolation. Atomic models will consist of a single nucleus that may be surrounded by one or more bound electrons. It is not concerned with the formation of molecules (although much of the physics is identical), nor does it examine atoms in a solid state as condensed matter. It is concerned with processes such as ionization and excitation by photons or collisions with atomic particles. While modelling atoms in isolation may not seem realistic, if one considers atoms in a gas or plasma then the time-scales for atom-atom interactions are huge in comparison to the atomic processes that are generally considered. This means that the individual atoms can be treated as if each were in isolation, as the vast majority of the time they\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Fine structure\nContent: text: In atomic physics, the fine structure describes the splitting of the spectral lines of atoms due to electron spin and relativistic corrections to the non- relativistic Schrödinger equation. It was first measured precisely for the hydrogen atom by Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley in 1887, laying the basis for the theoretical treatment by Arnold Sommerfeld, introducing the fine-structure constant. ==Background== ===Gross structure=== The gross structure of line spectra is the line spectra predicted by the quantum mechanics of non-relativistic electrons with no spin. For a hydrogenic atom, the gross structure energy levels only depend on the principal quantum number n. However, a more accurate model takes into account relativistic and spin effects, which break the degeneracy of the energy levels and split the spectral lines. The scale of the fine structure splitting relative to the gross structure energies is on the order of (Zα)2, where Z is the atomic number and α is the fine-structure constant, a dimensionless number equal to approximately 1/137. ===Relativistic corrections=== The fine structure energy corrections can be obtained by using perturbation theory. To perform this calculation one must add the three corrective terms to the Hamiltonian: the leading order relativistic correction to the kinetic energy, the correction due to the spin–orbit coupling, and the Darwin term coming from the quantum fluctuating motion or zitterbewegung of the electron. These corrections can also be obtained from the non-relativistic limit of the Dirac equation, since Dirac's theory naturally incorporates relativity and spin interactions. ==The hydrogen atom== This section discusses the analytical solutions for the hydrogen atom as the problem is analytically solvable and is the base model for energy level calculations in more complex atoms. ===Kinetic energy relativistic\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Chemistry\nContent: positive charge of the protons. The nucleus is dense; the mass of a nucleon is approximately 1,836 times that of an electron, yet the radius of an atom is about 10,000 times that of its nucleus. The atom is also the smallest entity that can be envisaged to retain the chemical properties of the element, such as electronegativity, ionization potential, preferred oxidation state(s), coordination number, and preferred types of bonds to form (e.g., metallic, ionic, covalent). ====Element==== A chemical element is a pure substance which is composed of a single type of atom, characterized by its particular number of protons in the nuclei of its atoms, known as the atomic number and represented by the symbol Z. The mass number is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in a nucleus. Although all the nuclei of all atoms belonging to one element will have the same atomic number, they may not necessarily have the same mass number; atoms of an element which have different mass numbers are known as isotopes. For example, all atoms with 6 protons in their nuclei are atoms of the chemical element carbon, but atoms of carbon may have mass numbers of 12 or 13. The standard presentation of the chemical elements is in the periodic table, which orders elements by atomic number. The periodic table is arranged in groups, or columns, and periods, or rows. The periodic table is useful in identifying periodic trends. ====Compound==== A compound is a pure chemical substance composed of more than one element. The properties of a compound bear little similarity to those of its elements. The standard nomenclature of compounds is set by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). Organic compounds are named according to\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Crystal structure\nContent: text: In crystallography, crystal structure is a description of the ordered arrangement of atoms, ions, or molecules in a crystalline material. Ordered structures occur from the intrinsic nature of the constituent particles to form symmetric patterns that repeat along the principal directions of three- dimensional space in matter. The smallest group of particles in the material that constitutes this repeating pattern is the unit cell of the structure. The unit cell completely reflects the symmetry and structure of the entire crystal, which is built up by repetitive translation of the unit cell along its principal axes. The translation vectors define the nodes of the Bravais lattice. The lengths of the principal axes, or edges, of the unit cell and the angles between them are the lattice constants, also called lattice parameters or cell parameters. The symmetry properties of the crystal are described by the concept of space groups. All possible symmetric arrangements of particles in three-dimensional space may be described by the 230 space groups. The crystal structure and symmetry play a critical role in determining many physical properties, such as cleavage, electronic band structure, and optical transparency. == Unit cell == Crystal structure is described in terms of the geometry of arrangement of particles in the unit cells. The unit cell is defined as the smallest repeating unit having the full symmetry of the crystal structure. The geometry of the unit cell is defined as a parallelepiped, providing six lattice parameters taken as the lengths of the cell edges (a, b, c) and the angles between them (α, β, γ). The positions of particles inside the unit cell are described by the fractional coordinates (xi, yi, zi) along the cell edges, measured from a reference point. It is thus, only necessary to report the coordinates\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Biomaterial\nContent: material (ceramic, metal, or polymer). === Microstructure === thumb|A unit cell shows the locations of lattice points repeating in all directions. The microstructure of a material refers to the structure of an object, organism, or material as viewed at magnifications exceeding 25 times. It is composed of the different phases of form, size, and distribution of grains, pores, precipitates, etc. The majority of solid microstructures are crystalline, however some materials such as certain polymers will not crystallize when in the solid state. ==== Crystalline structure ==== Crystalline structure is the composition of ions, atoms, and molecules that are held together and ordered in a 3D shape. The main difference between a crystalline structure and an amorphous structure is the order of the components. Crystalline has the highest level of order possible in the material where amorphous structure consists of irregularities in the ordering pattern. One way to describe crystalline structures is through the crystal lattice, which is a 3-dimensional representation of the location of a repeating factor (unit cell) in the structure denoted with lattices. There are 14 different configurations of atom arrangement in a crystalline structure, and are all represented under Bravais Lattices. ==== Defects of crystalline structure ==== During the formation of a crystalline structure, different impurities, irregularities, and other defects can form. These imperfections can form through deformation of the solid, rapid cooling, or high energy radiation. Types of defects include point defects, line defects, as well as edge dislocation. === Macrostructure === Macrostructure refers to the overall geometric properties that will influence the force at failure, stiffness, bending, stress distribution, and the weight of the material. It requires little to no magnification to reveal the macrostructure of a material.

Efforts to reduce pollution from mobile sources includes expanding regulation to new sources (such as cruise and transport ships, farm equipment, and small gas-powered equipment such as string trimmers, chainsaws, and snowmobiles), increased fuel efficiency (such as through the use of hybrid vehicles), conversion to cleaner fuels, and conversion to electric vehicles. A very effective means to reduce air pollution is the transition to renewable energy. According to a study published in Energy and Environmental Science in 2015 the switch to 100% renewable energy in the United States would eliminate about 62,000 premature mortalities per year and about 42,000 in 2050, if no biomass were used. This would save about $600 billion in health costs a year due to reduced air pollution in 2050, or about 3.6% of the 2014 U.S. gross domestic product. Air quality improvement is a near-term benefit among the many societal benefits from climate change mitigation. === Alternatives to pollution === thumb|Support for a ban on high-emission vehicles in city centres in Europe, China and the US from respondents to the European Investment Bank Climate Survey There are now practical alternatives to the principal causes of air pollution: * Strategic substitution of air pollution sources in transport with lower-emission or, during the lifecycle, emission- free forms of public transport and bicycle use and infrastructure (as well as with remote work, reductions of work, relocations, and localizations) ** Phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles is a critical component of a shift to sustainable transport; however, similar infrastructure and design decisions like electric vehicles may be associated with similar pollution for production as well as mining and resource exploitation for large numbers of needed batteries as well as the energy for their recharging *\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Air pollution\nContent: renewable energy transitions. Efforts to reduce particulate matter in the air may result in better health. The 9-Euro-Ticket scheme in Germany which allowed people to buy a monthly pass allowing use on all local and regional transport (trains, trams and busses) for 9 euro (€) for one month of unlimited travel saved 1.8 million tons of emissions during its three-month implementation from June to August 2022. === Pollution control === Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution.Fensterstock, Ketcham and Walsh, The Relationship of Land Use and Transportation Planning to Air Quality Management, Ed. George Hagevik, May 1972. At its most basic level, land-use planning is likely to involve zoning and transport infrastructure planning. In most developed countries, land-use planning is an important part of social policy, ensuring that land is used efficiently for the benefit of the wider economy and population, as well as to protect the environment. Stringent environmental regulations, effective control technologies and shift towards the renewable source of energy also helping countries like China and India to reduce their sulfur dioxide pollution. Titanium dioxide has been researched for its ability to reduce air pollution. Ultraviolet light will release free electrons from material, thereby creating free radicals, which break up VOCs and gases. One form is superhydrophilic. Pollution-eating nanoparticles placed near a busy road were shown to absorb toxic emission from around 20 cars each day. === Energy transition === Since a large share of air pollution is caused by combustion of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, the reduction of these fuels can reduce air pollution drastically. Most effective is the switch to clean power sources such as wind power, solar power, hydro power which do not cause air pollution.

The same analysis found that the most important factors to tackle first include wood-burning heating systems and heavy traffic. Some of the proposed solutions to tackle air pollution problems include better public transport, using solar heating and pedestrianizing the city center. Additionally, nationwide gasification programs have been listed as the primary solution for the use of carbon and other pieces of furniture. ==Water pollution== As there was no existing information on the level of water pollution in 2021, the discharge of harmful and dangerous substances in water bodies without a permit is not prohibited with sanctions for illegal actions. This includes wastewater from industry and mining that gets released into the soil, sewage, watercourses, reservoirs and lakes. Wastewater in turn, gets generated from several sources, including industrial and mining wastewaters, wastewaters from households and wastewaters from agriculture. ==Public reactions and government initiatives== Many initiatives have been taken by the locals and the government to tackle and raise awareness about the issue of pollution. An AirCare application has been developed by an engineering student to monitor pollution levels and it gained widespread use by the wider public. Thousands of high school students protested on 20 December 2019 in front of the government building as part of global climate movements. The judiciary system in the country is responsible to take measures against air pollutants when there is enough evidence that pollution is harmful to health through central and local politics.\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Air pollution\nContent: batteries as well as the energy for their recharging * Areas downwind (over 20 miles) of major airports have more than double total particulate emissions in air than other areas, even when factoring in areas with frequent ship calls, and heavy freeway and city traffic like Los Angeles. Aviation biofuel mixed in with jetfuel at a 50/50 ratio can reduce jet derived cruise altitude particulate emissions by 50–70%, according to a NASA led 2017 study (however, this should imply ground level benefits to urban air pollution as well). * Ship propulsion and idling can be switched to much cleaner fuels like natural gas. (Ideally a renewable source but not practical yet) * Combustion of fossil fuels for space heating can be replaced by using ground source heat pumps and seasonal thermal energy storage. * Electricity generated from the combustion of fossil fuels can be replaced by nuclear and renewable energy. Heating and home stoves, which contribute significantly to regional air pollution, can be replaced with a much cleaner fossil fuel, such as natural gas, or, preferably, renewables, in poor countries. * Motor vehicles driven by fossil fuels, a key factor in urban air pollution, can be replaced by electric vehicles. Though lithium supply and cost is a limitation, there are alternatives. Herding more people into clean public transit such as electric trains can also help. Nevertheless, even in emission-free electric vehicles, rubber tires produce significant amounts of air pollution themselves, ranking as 13th worst pollutant in Los Angeles. *Reducing travel in vehicles can curb pollution.

The World Health Organization declared in 2014 that air contamination caused around 7 million deaths in 2012. This new technology could be an essential asset to this epidemic. The three ways that nanotechnology is being used to treat air pollution are nano- adsorptive materials, degradation by nanocatalysis, and filtration/separation by nanofilters. Nanoscale adsorbents being the main alleviator for many air pollution difficulties. Their structure permits a great interaction with organic compounds as well as increased selectivity and stability in maximum adsorption capacity. Other advantages include high electrical and thermal conductivities, high strength, high hardness. Target pollutants that can be targeted by nanomolecules are 〖NO〗_x, 〖CO〗_2, 〖NH〗_3, N_2, VOCs, Isopropyl vapor, 〖CH〗_3 OH gases, N_2 O, H_2 S. Carbon nanotubes specifically remove particles in many ways. One method is by passing them through the nanotubes where the molecules are oxidized; the molecules then are adsorbed on a nitrate species. Carbon nanotubes with amine groups provide numerous chemical sites for carbon dioxide adsorption at low temperature ranges of 20°-100° degrees Celsius. Van der Waals forces and π-π interactions also are used to pull molecules onto surface functional groups. Fullerene can be used to rid of carbon dioxide pollution due to its high adsorption capacity. Graphene nanotubes have functional groups that adsorb gases. There are plenty of nanocatalysts that can be used for air pollution reduction and air quality. Some of these materials include 〖TiO〗_2, Vanadium, Platinum, Palladium, Rhodium, and Silver. Catalytic industrial emission reduction, car exhaust reduction, and air purification are just some of the major thrusts that these nanomaterials are being\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Air quality and EU legislation\nContent: 2050 of reducing air pollution to levels no longer considered harmful to health.\" The current action plan has a target of 25 percent reduction in air pollution impacts on the environment by 2030.

Indoor Air Pollution (IAP) exposure can be greatly reduced by cooking outdoors, reducing time spent in the cooking area, keeping the kitchen door open while cooking, avoid leaning over the fire while attending to the meal preparation, staying away while carrying children when cooking and keeping the children away from the cooking area. Negative impacts can also be reduced by changes to the environment (e.g. use of a chimney), drying fuel wood before use, and using a lid during cooking.Indoor air pollution and health - World Health Organization fact sheet. Opportunities to educate communities on reducing household indoor air pollution exposure include festival collaborations, religious meetings, and medical outreach clinics. Community health workers represent a significant resource for educating communities to help raise awareness regarding reducing the effects of indoor air pollution.Amegah, A. K., & Jaakkola, J. J. (2016). Household air pollution and the sustainable development goals. Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 94(3), 215. ==Challenges== thumb|Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking. Many users of clean stoves and fuels continue to make frequent use of traditional fuels and stoves, a phenomenon known as \"fuel stacking\" or \"stove stacking\". For instance, a recent study in Kenya found that households that are primary LPG users consume 42 percent as much charcoal as households that are primary charcoal users. When stacking is practiced, the introduction of clean cooking facilities may not reduce household air pollution enough to make a meaningful difference in health outcomes. There are many reasons to continue to use traditional fuels and stoves, such as unreliable fuel supply, the cost of fuel, the ability of stoves\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Pollution in California\nContent: Fine Particle Pollution Poses Serious Health Threats: * Causes early death (both short-term and long-term exposure) * Causes cardiovascular harm (e.g. heart attacks, strokes, heart disease, congestive heart failure) * Likely to cause respiratory harm (e.g. worsened asthma, worsened COPD, inflammation) * May cause cancer * May cause reproductive and developmental harm === Ways to Prevent Health Dangers === Personal exposure to the air pollution can be reduced by staying indoors on days with levels of high air pollution. Air quality can be checked by using scales that mention moderate, unhealthy, or hazardous air quality conditions. Other ways to avoid the air pollution would be reducing outdoor air infiltration to indoors, cleaning indoor air with air filters, and limiting physical exertion, especially outdoors and near air pollution sources. Avoiding exposure to air pollutants is especially important for susceptible individuals with chronic cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, children, and the elderly. There are also pharmaceutical or chemopreventive interventions such as antioxidants. Many health threats from poor air quality can cause cancer, avoiding the air pollution and taking antioxidants will help improve the health of those who are most affected by poor air quality. ==== Asthma Friendly Outdoor for Children ==== The specific purpose of the Asthma- Friendly Outdoor (Ambient) Air Quality Flag Program was to establish an education and communication tool for Central California communities that would accomplish two things: (1) Establish permanent local policy change to existing operating procedures in school districts and schools to help reduce the exposure of students, teachers, staff, and nearby communities to outdoor environmental asthma triggers and (2) provide education on air quality and potential health effects of exposure to air pollutants.

In the \"deliberation\" phase, people have to decide what to do. If a person does not have a plan in place, this causes a serious problem because the effects of life-threatening stress on the body (e.g. tunnel vision, audio exclusion, time dilations, out-of-body experiences, or reduced motor skills) limit an individual's ability to perceive information and make plans. Ripley asserts that in the third and final phase, described as the \"decisive moment\", a person must act quickly and decisively. Failure to do so can result in injury or death. She explains that the faster someone can get through the denial and deliberation phases, the quicker they will reach the decisive moment and begin to take action. == Examples == thumb|Normalcy bias can occur during car crashes. Journalist David McRaney wrote that \"Normalcy bias flows into the brain no matter the scale of the problem. It will appear whether you have days and plenty of warning or are blindsided with only seconds between life and death.\" It can manifest itself in phenomena such as car crashes. Car crashes occur very frequently, but the average individual experiences them only rarely, if ever. It also manifests itself in connection with events in world history. According to a 2001 study by sociologist Thomas Drabek, when people are asked to leave in anticipation of a disaster, most check with four or more sources of information before deciding what to do. The process of checking in, known as milling, is common in disasters. thumb|Vesuvius erupting As for events in world history, the normalcy bias can explain why, when the volcano Vesuvius erupted, the residents of Pompeii watched for hours without evacuating.\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Delaying tactic\nContent: outcomes. An individual may delay making a decision in the hope that a better option will become available or that the decision will be made for them by others or by changing circumstances. Delay tactics and indecision can be a symptom of mild to severe mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. Delaying and indecision can also be the result of fear of making a poor choice. This can stem from an obsessive desire to identify the optimal solution by gathering more information. This can result in the decision being postponed indefinitely, especially in situations where some degree of uncertainty is unavoidable.https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1141&context;=faculty_scholarship This can be further exacerbated if the individual has trauma associated with the consequences of their past decisions. === Delaying tactics survival value === Delaying tactics are a part of the body's natural response to perceived threats. Freezing is a primary instinctive survival response along with fight and flight Freezing is an automatic, involuntary response to fear. This tactic delays other responses, allowing for more time to process the situation and gather information before taking any action. Freezing may also occur when neither fight or flight is an available option. If there is no decision to make, freezing is not a delaying tactic. == Related negotiation tactics == * Active silence: The negotiator uses silence skillfully to induce a targeted discomfort in the other parties. The silence serves as a sign that the negotiator is confident and expects a response. * Bigger picture: The negotiator makes light of the proposed issue, and turns the focus to a wider discussion. *Bluff: The negotiator makes a false claim, as if he has better offers from other parties. *Bogeyman: The negotiator introduces a false threat or warning.\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Group decision-making\nContent: text: Group decision-making (also known as collaborative decision-making or collective decision-making) is a situation faced when individuals collectively make a choice from the alternatives before them. The decision is then no longer attributable to any single individual who is a member of the group. This is because all the individuals and social group processes such as social influence contribute to the outcome. The decisions made by groups are often different from those made by individuals. In workplace settings, collaborative decision-making is one of the most successful models to generate buy-in from other stakeholders, build consensus, and encourage creativity. According to the idea of synergy, decisions made collectively also tend to be more effective than decisions made by a single individual. In this vein, certain collaborative arrangements have the potential to generate better net performance outcomes than individuals acting on their own. Under normal everyday conditions, collaborative or group decision-making would often be preferred and would generate more benefits than individual decision-making when there is the time for proper deliberation, discussion, and dialogue. This can be achieved through the use of committee, teams, groups, partnerships, or other collaborative social processes. However, in some cases, there can also be drawbacks to this method. In extreme emergencies or crisis situations, other forms of decision-making might be preferable as emergency actions may need to be taken more quickly with less time for deliberation. On the other hand, additional considerations must also be taken into account when evaluating the appropriateness of a decision-making framework. For example, the possibility of group polarization also can occur at times, leading some groups to make more extreme decisions than those of its individual members, in the direction of the individual inclinations. There are also other examples where the decisions made by a group\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Recognition-primed decision\nContent: text: Recognition-primed decision (RPD) is a model of how people make quick, effective decisions when faced with complex situations. In this model, the decision maker is assumed to generate a possible course of action, compare it to the constraints imposed by the situation, and select the first course of action that is not rejected. RPD has been described in diverse groups including trauma nurses, fireground commanders, chess players, and stock market traders. It functions well in conditions of time pressure, and in which information is partial and goals poorly defined. The limitations of RPD include the need for extensive experience among decision-makers (in order to correctly recognize the salient features of a problem and model solutions) and the problem of the failure of recognition and modeling in unusual or misidentified circumstances. It appears, as discussed by Gary A. Klein in Sources of Power, to be a valid model for how human decision-makers make decisions. ==Overview== The RPD model identifies a reasonable reaction as the first one that is immediately considered. RPD combines two ways of developing a decision; the first is recognizing which course of action makes sense, and the second, evaluating the course of action through imagination to see if the actions resulting from that decision make sense. However, the difference of being experienced or inexperienced plays a major factor in the decision-making processes. RPD reveals a critical difference between experts and novices when presented with recurring situations. Experienced people will generally be able to come up with a quicker decision because the situation may match a prototypical situation they have encountered before. Novices, lacking this experience, must cycle through different possibilities, and tend to use the first course of action that they believe will work. The inexperienced also have the tendencies of using\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Consensus decision-making\nContent: delegates in a reasonable time. Additionally, the time commitment required to engage in the consensus decision-making process can sometimes act as a barrier to participation for individuals unable or unwilling to make the commitment. However, once a decision has been reached it can be acted on more quickly than a decision handed down. American businessmen complained that in negotiations with a Japanese company, they had to discuss the idea with everyone even the janitor, yet once a decision was made the Americans found the Japanese were able to act much quicker because everyone was on board, while the Americans had to struggle with internal opposition. == Similar practices == Outside of Western culture, multiple other cultures have used consensus decision-making. One early example is the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederacy Grand Council, which used a 75% supermajority to finalize its decisions, potentially as early as 1142. In the Xulu and Xhosa (South African) process of indaba, community leaders gather to listen to the public and negotiate figurative thresholds towards an acceptable compromise. The technique was also used during the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference. In Aceh and Nias cultures (Indonesian), family and regional disputes, from playground fights to estate inheritance, are handled through a musyawarah consensus-building process in which parties mediate to find peace and avoid future hostility and revenge. The resulting agreements are expected to be followed, and range from advice and warnings to compensation and exile. The origins of formal consensus-making can be traced significantly further back, to the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, who adopted the technique as early as the 17th century. Anabaptists, including some Mennonites, have a history of using consensus decision-making and some believe Anabaptists practiced consensus as early as the Martyrs' Synod of 1527.\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Decision fatigue\nContent: well as cognitive self-control. ==Effects== ===Reduced ability to make trade-offs=== thumb|right|250px|When consumers visit car dealerships, they may feel overwhelmed by all of the different financing, upgrades, and warranty options. Trade-offs, where either of two choices have positive and negative elements, are an advanced and energy-consuming form of decision making. A person who is mentally depleted becomes reluctant to make trade-offs, or makes very poor choices. Jonathan Levav at Stanford University designed experiments showing how decision fatigue can leave a person vulnerable to sales and marketing strategies designed to time the sale. \"Decision fatigue helps explain why ordinarily sensible people...can't resist the dealer's offer to rustproof their new car.\" Dean Spears of Princeton University has argued that decision fatigue caused by the constant need to make financial trade-offs is a major factor in trapping people in poverty.. Given that financial situations force the poor to make so many trade-offs, they are left with less mental energy for other activities. \"If a trip to the supermarket induces more decision fatigue in the poor than in the rich – because each purchase requires more mental trade-offs – by the time they reach the cash register, they'll have less willpower left to resist the Mars bars and Skittles. Not for nothing are these items called impulse purchases.\" ===Decision avoidance=== Decision fatigue can lead people to avoid decisions entirely, a phenomenon called \"Decision avoidance\".. In the formal approach to decision quality management, specific techniques have been devised to help managers cope with decision fatigue.. Other forms of decision avoidance used to bypass trade-offs and the emotional costs of decision making can include selecting either the default, or status quo options, where these are available. ===Impulse purchasing=== Decision fatigue can influence irrational impulse\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Decision fatigue\nContent: text: In decision making and psychology, decision fatigue refers to the deteriorating quality of decisions made by an individual after a long session of decision making.. It is now understood as one of the causes of irrational trade-offs in decision making. Decision fatigue may also lead to consumers making poor choices with their purchases. There is a paradox in that \"people who lack choices seem to want them and often will fight for them\", yet at the same time, \"people find that making many choices can be [psychologically] aversive.\" For example, major politicians and businessmen such as former United States President Barack Obama, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg have been known to reduce their everyday clothing down to one or two outfits in order to limit the number of decisions they make in a day. == Definition and context == Decision fatigue is a phrase popularised by John Tierney, and is the tendency for peoples’ decision making to become impaired as a result of having recently taken multiple decisions. Decision fatigue has been hypothesised to be a symptom, or a result of ego depletion. It differs from mental fatigue which describes the psychobiological state that results from a prolonged duration of demanding cognitive tasks, such as multi-tasking or switching between various tasks. Some psychologists and economists use the term to describe impairments in decision making resulting specifically from a long duration of having to make decisions. Others view factors such as complexity of the decisions being made, repeated acts of self regulation, physiological fatigue, and sleep deprivation as implicated in the emergence of decision fatigue. Decision fatigue is thought to be a result of unconscious, psychobiological processes, and is a reaction to sustained cognitive, emotional and decisional load, as opposed to a trait or deficiency.\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Dynamic decision-making\nContent: relies on the global, high-level decision making process, consisting of five stages: recognition, judgment, choice, execution, and feedback. When people are faced with a particular environment's situation, people are likely to retrieve similar instances from memory to make a decision. In atypical situations (those that are not similar to anything encountered in the past), retrieval from memory is not possible and people would need to use a heuristic (which does not rely on memory) to make a decision. In situations that are typical and where inss can be retrieved, evaluation of the utility of the similar instances takes place until a necessity level is crossed. Necessity is typically determined by the decision maker's “aspiration level,” similar to Simon and March's satisficing strategy. But the necessity level might also be determined by external environmental factors like time constraints (as in the medical domain with doctors in an emergency room treating patients in a time critical situation). Once that necessity level is crossed, the decision involving the instance with the highest utility is made. The outcome of the decision, when received, is then used to update the utility of the instance that was used to make the decision in the first place (from expected to experienced). This generic decision making process is assumed to apply to any dynamic decision making situation, when decisions are made from experience. The computational representation of IBLT relies on several learning mechanisms proposed by a generic theory of cognition, ACT-R. Currently, there are many decision tasks that have been implemented in the IBLT that reproduces and explains human behavior accurately.Gonzalez, C., & Lebiere, C. (2005).

The app allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters and organized by hashtags and geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with preapproved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tag and location, view trending content, like photos, and follow other users to add their content to a personal feed. Instagram was originally distinguished by allowing content to be framed only in a square (1:1) aspect ratio of 640 pixels to match the display width of the iPhone at the time. In 2015, this restriction was eased with an increase to 1080 pixels. It also added messaging features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post, and a Stories feature—similar to its main competitor Snapchat—which allowed users to post their content to a sequential feed, with each post accessible to others for 24 hours. As of January 2019, Stories is used by 500 million people daily. Originally launched for iOS in October 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, Instagram rapidly gained popularity, with one million registered users in two months, 10 million in a year, and 1 billion by June 2018. In April 2012, Facebook Inc. acquired the service for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock. The Android version was released in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited desktop interface in November 2012, a Fire OS app in June 2014, and an app for Windows 10 in October 2016. , over 40 billion photos had been uploaded.

Social media sites like Twitter, which are among the most affected with CNBC reporting up to 48 million of the 319 million users (roughly 15%) were bots in 2017, continue to fight against the spread of misinformation, scams and other harmful activities on their platforms. ==Platforms== ===Instagram=== Instagram reached a billion active monthly users in June 2018, but of those 1 billion active users it was estimated that up to 10% were being run by automated social bots. Instagram's unique platform for sharing pictures and videos makes it one of the biggest targets for malicious social bot attacks, especially porn bot accounts, because imagery resonates with the platform's users more than simple words on platforms like Twitter. While malicious propaganda posting bots are still popular, many individual users use engagement bots to propel themselves to a false virality, making them seem more popular on the app. These engagement bots can do everything from like, watch, follow, and comment on the users' posts. Around the same time that the platform achieved the 1 billion monthly user plateau, Facebook (Instagram and WhatsApp's parent company) planned to hire 10 000 to provide additional security to their platforms, this would include combatting the rising number of bots and malicious posts on the platforms. Due to increased security on the platform and enhanced detecting methods by Instagram, some botting companies are reporting issues with their services because Instagram imposes interaction limit thresholds based on past and current app usage and many payment and email platforms deny the companies access to their services, preventing potential clients from being able to purchase them. ===Twitter=== Twitter's bot problem is being caused by the ease of use in creating\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Twitter\nContent: text: Twitter is an online social media and social networking service owned and operated by American company X Corp., the successor of Twitter, Inc. Twitter users outside the United States are legally served by the Ireland-based Twitter International Unlimited Company, which makes these users subject to Irish and European Union data protection laws. On Twitter, users post texts, images and videos known as \"tweets\". Registered users can tweet, like, \"retweet\" tweets, and direct message (DM) other registered users, while unregistered users only have the ability to view public tweets. Users interact with Twitter through browser or mobile frontend software, or programmatically via its application programming interfaces (APIs). Twitter was created by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams in March 2006 and launched in July of that year. Its former parent company, Twitter, Inc. was based in San Francisco, California and had more than 25 offices around the world. , more than 100 million users tweeted 340 million tweets a day, and the service handled an average of 1.6 billion search queries per day. In 2013, it was one of the ten most-visited websites and has been described as \"the SMS of the Internet\". , Twitter had more than 330 million monthly active users. In practice, the vast majority of tweets are tweeted by a minority of users. In 2020, it was estimated that approximately 48 million accounts (15% of all accounts) were fake. On October 27, 2022, business magnate Elon Musk acquired Twitter for US$44 billion, gaining control of the platform.

It is estimated that approximately 20% of all ISIS affiliated Twitter accounts can be traced back to fake accounts created by the same user. Many of these accounts are traced back to the “Baqiya family,” which is an online network of thousands of ISIS followers. Many of these accounts are active during important ISIS military victories. During the ISIS march on Mosul, there were about 42,000 tweets on Twitter supporting the invasion. === Telegram === During 2014, ISIS became very active on Telegram after many major social media platforms banned ISIS content and sympathetic accounts. Telegram is an encrypted messaging application. The platform by nature is created as an end- to-end user encryption platform. Further, it also has special features such as the self-destruct timer which erase all evidence and messages. The app has a user data protection policy because violating this policy could potentially damage the app’s brand of customer privacy. Government agencies have been unable to break Telegram's encryption technology. On Telegram, ISIS often uses the hashtag #KhilafahNews to attract their users. Telegram is used by ISIS to plan social media campaigns on alternate platforms. The organization also uses Telegram as an anchor platform to connect with their user base when their other accounts are banned on Twitter and Facebook. On 28 February 2016 a video was uploaded threatening to expose the najaasah and shoot the hesitates. Produced by Ibn-Altayb and distributed by Al-Hayat, the video shows footage of Bruxelles attacks and the victims. In July 2017, Telegram came under scrutiny from the media and news media outlets.

Retrieved December 10, 2015. Instagram was listed among Times \"50 Best Android Applications for 2013\" list. === Mental health === In May 2017, a survey conducted by the United Kingdom's Royal Society for Public Health, featuring 1,479 people aged 14–24, asking them to rate social media platforms depending on anxiety, depression, loneliness, bullying and body image, concluded that Instagram was the \"worst for young mental health\". Some have suggested it may contribute to digital dependence, whilst this same survey noticed its positive effects, including self-expression, self-identity, and community building. In response to the survey, Instagram stated that \"Keeping Instagram a safe and supportive place for young people was a top priority\". The company filters out the reviews and accounts. If some of the accounts violate Instagram's community guidelines, it will take action, which could include banning them. In 2017, researchers from Harvard University and University of Vermont demonstrated a machine learning tool that successfully outperformed general practitioners' diagnostic success rate for depression. The tool used color analysis, metadata components, and face detection of users' feeds.

Singer and Emerson T. Brooking, the use of effective social media marketing techniques is not only limited to celebrities, corporations, and governments, but also extremist groups to carry out political objectives based on extremist ideologies. The use of social media by ISIS and Al-Qaeda has been used primarily to influence operations in areas of operation and gain the attention of sympathizers of extremist ideologies. Social media platforms like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and various encrypted-messaging applications have been used to increase the recruiting of members into these extremist groups, both locally and internationally. Larger platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and various others have received backlash for allowing this type of content on their platform (see Use of social media by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant). The use of social media to further extremist objectives is not only limited to Islamic terrorism, but also extreme nationalist groups across the world, and more prominently, right-wing extremist groups based out of the United States. ==== 2021 United States Capitol attack ==== As many of the traditional social media platforms banned hate speech (see Online hate speech), several platforms have become popular among right-wing extremists to carry out planning and communication of thoughts and organized events; these application became known as \"Alt-tech\".

The hashtag #NotYourAsianSidekick was initiated by Suey Park and Juliet Shen in December 2013 on Twitter. Suey Park is a freelance writer who is most known for her Twitter campaign to cancel the Colbert Show, while Juliet Shen ran a blog on Asian American feminism. They started the hashtag town hall as a way to create a platform for structured conversation around misogyny and issues specific to Asian American women. In less than 24 hours, #NotYourAsianSidekick had been used over 45,000 times. DeafTalent is a hashtag used to highlight through social media the capabilities of the deaf and hard of hearing community. Prior to the hashtag's emergence, in the creative industry, hearing actors had been cast in deaf roles. The SAGE Deaf Studies Encyclopedia wrote, \"In response to this, the social media hashtags #DeafTalent and #POCDeafTalent were created. The hashtags, while originally used to point out problematic portrayals of deaf characters and sign language in the media, are now also used to celebrate the wide breadth and multiplicity of deaf actors, artists, and other talent in the world.\" The hashtag, #Boymom, has taken to social media platforms in order to display the so-called \"chaotic\" and \"messy\" experiences mothers of boys go through. Instagram appears to be the platform with the most #Boymom hashtags, with nearly 12.9 million hashtags. Interestingly, #Girlmom falls significantly behind in numbers with only 4.8 million.

Businesses are searchable by location, similar to Yellow Pages. The website is operational in seven different countries, including the United States and Canada. Business account holders are allowed to create, share, and edit business profiles. They may post information such as the business location, contact information, pictures, and service information. The website further allows individuals to write, post reviews about businesses, and rate them on a five-point scale. Messaging and talk features are further made available for general members of the website, serving to guide thoughts and opinions. ===Instagram=== thumb|The Instagram app In May 2014, Instagram had over 200 million users. The user engagement rate of Instagram was 15 times higher than of Facebook and 25 times higher than that of Twitter. According to Scott Galloway, the founder of L2 and a professor of marketing at New York University's Stern School of Business, latest studies estimate that 93% of prestige brands have an active presence on Instagram and include it in their marketing mix. When it comes to brands and businesses, Instagram's goal is to help companies to reach their respective audiences through captivating imagery in a rich, visual environment. Moreover, Instagram provides a platform where user and company can communicate publicly and directly, making itself an ideal platform for companies to connect with their current and potential customers.

This is almost always the main character (for example, Gabriel in James Joyce's \"The Dead\", Nathaniel Hawthorne's Young Goodman Brown, or Santiago in Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea). Certain third- person omniscient modes are also classifiable as using the third person, subjective mode when they switch between the thoughts and feelings of all the characters. In contrast to the broad, sweeping perspectives seen in many 19th- century novels, third-person subjective is sometimes called the \"over the shoulder\" perspective; the narrator only describes events perceived and information known by a character. At its narrowest and most subjective scope, the story reads as though the viewpoint character were narrating it; dramatically this is very similar to the first person, in that it allows in- depth revelation of the protagonist's personality, but it uses third-person grammar. Some writers will shift perspective from one viewpoint character to another, such as in Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time, or George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire. Free indirect speech is the presentation of a character's thoughts in the voice of the third-person narrator. Objective point of view employs a narrator who tells a story without describing any character's thoughts, opinions, or feelings; instead, it gives an objective, unbiased point of view. Often the narrator is self-dehumanized in order to make the narrative more neutral. This type of narrative mode is often seen outside of fiction in newspaper articles, biographical documents, and scientific journals. This narrative mode can be described as a \"fly-on-the- wall\" or \"camera lens\" approach\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Narration\nContent: First person creates a close relationship between the narrator and reader, by referring to the viewpoint character with first person pronouns like I and me (as well as we and us, whenever the narrator is part of a larger group). That is, the narrator openly acknowledges their own existence. Frequently, the first-person narrator is the protagonist, whose inner thoughts are expressed to the audience, even if not to any of the other characters. A first person narrator with a limited perspective is not able to witness or understand all facets of any situation. Thus, a narrator with this perspective will not be able to report the circumstances fully and will leave the reader with a subjective record of the plot details. Additionally, this narrator's character could be pursuing a hidden agenda or may be struggling with mental or physical challenges that further hamper their ability to tell the reader the whole, accurate truth of events. This form includes temporary first-person narration as a story within a story, wherein a narrator or character observing the telling of a story by another is reproduced in full, temporarily and without interruption shifting narration to the speaker. The first-person narrator can also be the focal character. The viewpoint character is not necessarily the focal character: examples of supporting viewpoint characters include Doctor Watson, Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird, and Nick Carraway of The Great Gatsby. === Second-person === The second-person point of view is a point of view where the audience is made a character. This is done with the use of second-person pronouns like you. The narrator could be literally addressing the audience, but more often the second-person referent of these stories is actually some character within the story. Novels in second person are comparatively rare; rather, this\n\nID: 2\nTitle: First-person narrative\nContent: text: A first-person narrative is a mode of storytelling in which a storyteller recounts events from their own point of view using the first person Grammarly, https://www.grammarly.com/blog/first-second-and-third- person/#:~:text=We%2C%20us%2C%20our%2Cand,%2C%20my%2C%20mine%20and%20myself.\" It may be narrated by a first-person protagonist (or other focal character), first-person re-teller, first-person witness, or first-person peripheral. A classic example of a first-person protagonist narrator is Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre (1847), in which the title character is also the narrator telling her own story, \"I could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me\". This device allows the audience to see the narrator's mind's eye view of the fictional universe, but it is limited to the narrator's experiences and awareness of the true state of affairs. In some stories, first-person narrators may relay dialogue with other characters or refer to information they heard from the other characters, in order to try to deliver a larger point of view. Other stories may switch the narrator to different characters in order to introduce a broader perspective. An unreliable narrator is one that has completely lost credibility due to ignorance, poor insight, personal biases, mistakes, dishonesty, etc., which challenges the reader's initial assumptions. ==Point of view device== \"First Person Narration\", Purdue University College of Liberal Arts ===Identity=== ===Varying structures=== Ranjbar Vahid. The Narrator, Iran:Baqney. 2011 In the first-person-plural point of view, narrators tell the story using \"we\".

The first-person-plural point of view occurs rarely but can be used effectively, sometimes as a means to increase the concentration\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Contemplation (short story collection)\nContent: not know, if nobody comes, then nobody comes…a pack of nobodies would be rather fine”. The narrator illustrates self-imposed isolation through images of mountains, a group of “nobodies” linked together going through the mountains, and the vivid image of the “nobodies” happily scavenging through the mountains. This is ironic because the reader can depict these images in any way they want, but based on the descriptions by Kafka it seems to be that the speaker is alone and him going into the mountains with this group of “nobodies” is him isolating himself from society. From \"Description of a Struggle\". === \"Bachelor's Ill Luck\" === The original German title is \"\". Also called “The Fate of a Bachelor,” this story is written in the third person. The narrator is describing the life of a bachelor and the increasing loneliness of that comes with the passing of time and no one with whom to share it. For example, the narrator imagines the bachelor lying sick in a room that is empty of any family to care for him, or having to repeatedly explain to others that he does not have any children of his own. The dominant motif in this story is loneliness. === \"The Businessman\" === The original German title is \"\" (The merchant). This short story is narrated through the perspective of a businessman. It is spoken in first person. In a world where he is experiencing a never-ending feeling of dissatisfaction, the businessman lives a mentally desolate life. He begins with describing the mental and physical stress that his work causes him such as aches, worry, anxiety, and fear. Although he is surrounded by other individuals and finds himself worrying about their problems, they are “strangers; their circumstances remain a\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Story within a story\nContent: text: A story within a story, also referred to as an embedded narrative, is a literary device in which a character within a story becomes the narrator of a second story (within the first one). Multiple layers of stories within stories are sometimes called nested stories. A play may have a brief play within it, such as Shakespeare's play Hamlet; a film may show the characters watching a short film; or a novel may contain a short story within the novel. A story within a story can be used in all types of narration: novels, short stories, plays, television programs, films, poems, songs, video games, and philosophical essays. The inner stories are told either simply to add entertainment or more usually to act as an example to the other characters. In either case, the inner story often has a symbolic and psychological significance for the characters in the outer story. There is often some parallel between the two stories, and the fiction of the inner story is used to reveal the truth in the outer story. Often the stories within a story are used to satirize views, not only in the outer story, but also in the real world. When a story is told within another instead of being told as part of the plot, it allows the author to play on the reader's perceptions of the characters—the motives and the reliability of the storyteller are automatically in question. Stories within a story may disclose the background of characters or events, tell of myths and legends that influence the plot, or even seem to be extraneous diversions from the plot. In some cases, the story within a story is involved in the action of the plot of the outer story. In others, the inner story is independent,\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Milica Mićić Dimovska\nContent: third-person narration, focalization, and internal monologue. She often switches between third-person omniscient narration and internal thought process, allowing for a smooth transition when she switches focus from character to character. This structure allows for many different views of the same event to be related to the reader and is employed extensively in The Cataract, for example. === Characters === Dimovka's main characters are usually women experiencing the disconnect between progress for the country and progress for the individual. However, rather than using women as a literary device, Mićić Dimovska examines their lives for the sake of illustrating the reality of their experiences. Usually the protagonists are working, middle-class women living in an urban setting. Often, the story revolves around the main characters' familial ties. An important theme is how these women deal with the lasting patriarchy and the roles to which society forces women to conform. She often gives her characters sharp observational skill. Starting with the body, her characters are acutely aware of themselves, their surroundings, and of the climate they are in. == Books == === The Cataract === Set in Novi Sad in the 1999, The Cataract is set in a Serbian society amidst great change. The Yugoslav succession was concluding, the Kosovo crisis was developing, and NATO was about to bomb Serbia. The novel is written through the perspective of a host of characters who, in some way or another, all represent some way in which Serbians are blind to crisis. However, Mićić Dimovka is not necessarily only interested in historical significance, she is most interested in the individual lives of Serbians in this time. The Cataract shows many people and explores their realities, giving the reader great insight into what life was really like for some\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Vergeltung\nContent: on the characters on the novel. Each chapter starts with an italicized autobiographical interlude, reporting in the first person on the fate of one of the characters, using the formats of letters, personal résumés and monologues. However, this novel provides no continuous action driven narrative, but comprises a succession of short episodes that pick-up on earlier plot-lines and progress them briefly before moving on. What takes place is therefore a constant staccato of rapidly changing locations, narratives and players. In this way the structure resembles that of some movies. There is little use of protagonists in the traditional sense, to define and progress the storylines. The book is driven, rather, by events around which the central conflicts revolve. Many of the characters are identified only by a military rank or by their profession, and this feeds the impression of a collectivized experience. To some extent narrative context is provided by the brief quasi-autobiographical sketches appearing in italic font at the start of each chapter, but these are nonetheless incomplete and fragmentary. Apart from those short biographical sections, the narrative developments are presented directly from the author. The all-knowing narrator, who does not himself participate in the action, communicates the thoughts and feelings of the various participants, but he does this by concentrating on external manifestations, and avoids comments or value judgements, leaving it for the reader to form any required assessments of characters' inner motivations and reactions. Through this overwhelmingly neutral narrative stance, which comes close to resembling a documentary approach, the novel becomes authentic and powerfully plausible. At the same time the sparsity of commentary summons up a bleak underlying nihilism. Exceptionally, right at the end, the writer breaches his neutral narrative stance for a moment. The narrator uses the authority which his\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Contemplation (short story collection)\nContent: run by. The narrator imagines several scenarios between these two men running past him. These scenarios include the two playing a game, the first running away from the second, or the two teaming up to catch an unknown third person. Depending on the scenario, the narrator feels that he would have different responsibilities. After these images pass through his mind he begins thinking that the two could have nothing to do with each other, they could be sleepwalking or returning home to their families. He then meditates on the image of the first man being the one in trouble, him being armed. The imagery in this short story is very important because, as the narrator changes his idea of the relationship between the two men, the image of the two men shifts drastically. The tone changes drastically with the narrator's change of scenario because he sets or takes away blame from one of the men, or the other. The theme of “The Men Passing By” is that of guilt and perception. The narrator's level of guilt changes with each shift of scenario and perception because, depending on the scenario, he feels that he needs to decide whether or not to intervene. Adaptations in Austrian Sign Language were done by the deaf actor Werner Mössler . === \"On the Tram\" === The original German title is \"\" (The passenger). \"On the Tram\" is a short story told in first-person perspective. It describes a man standing on a tram platform, contemplating the uncertainties of his place in the world. At one point, a woman approaches the tram and the narrator is struck by her vibrance.

Upon being left to eat his meal, Bean realises that he ordered a steak tartare, whereupon he becomes disgusted by the meal upon tasting it and being forced to swallow the first bite so as to avoid upsetting the restaurant staff. Seeking to avoid eating the rest of it, Bean cuts it up and sticks bits of the meal in random places on his table. First, he hides some of it in an ashtray then a tiny flower vase, before hollowing out a portion of the bread roll on his table and using the hollow to hide more of the meal, before sliding some under a small plate, and another portion within the base of a sugar bowl. Shortly after this, a violinist walks towards his table and, spotting his card, plays \"Happy Birthday\" for him, before playing another tune, holding on a note until Bean eats another piece of steak. As soon as the violinist turns his back on him, Bean spits it down the violinist's trousers. Spotting that a woman on a neighbouring table is distracted by the tunes of the violin, Bean takes her handbag and puts pieces of the steak into it, but while putting it back, the waiter trips up over his outstretched leg. Using this opportunity to cover up his actions, Bean declares that the accident caused his meal to be spread everywhere he hid it, leading the maître d' to apologise for the accident and relocate him to another table. The waiter soon brings over a new meal on the house, which, to Bean's horror, turns out to be another steak tartare which is slightly larger than the original.

When looking for a new telephone, Bean finds the ones on display do not have a dialling tone and thinks they do not work, but eventually takes one from a receptionist's desk when he finds it works. At the checkout, he sets his card on the counter, only for another customer to mistakenly take it after accidentally covering up his own charge card of the same kind that the cashier had returned. Bean, realising this, pickpockets the man and swaps the cards back (instead of simply speaking with the man about the mix-up), but while returning the customer's wallet to his back pocket, he gets his hand stuck and finds himself being unwittingly pulled all the way into the men's toilets. In the cubicle, Bean finds himself trapped, with the customer not knowing he is there until he helps him to find the toilet roll; though the man initially accepts gratefully, he suddenly realises that he is not alone in the cubicle and jumps up in fright as Bean smiles nervously at him. === Act 2: The Restaurant === Bean goes to a fancy restaurant to celebrate his birthday. While making his choice and leaving the money for the food on a plate, he writes out a birthday card to himself, feigning surprise upon opening and reading it. When the maître d' returns, Bean orders what he thinks will be a regular steak, and as he waits for his food, he takes a moment to sample some of the house wine before using the glasses on his table to chime out \"Happy Birthday to Me\".

As a means of remedying their situation, they proceed to eat everything in sight: the flowers, their napkins, their shoes, belts, pants, jackets, shirts, underwear, plates, tablecloth, table, and chairs, leaving both of them nude and seated on the floor. While this is happening, the vagabond watches the businessman, then eats what he eats. They also try to get the waiter's attention whenever he passes by, to no avail. In the end, after everything else has been eaten, the businessman eats his utensils, prompting the vagabond to eat his. The businessman then smiles, pulls his utensils from his mouth, and advances on the vagabond, who recoils in horror. ===Dinner=== In a luxurious restaurant, a wealthy gourmet sits at a table, adding many sauces, spices, and sides to his meal, which is hidden from the viewer by the sheer number of condiments. This process continues for a long time, during which the gourmet collects stains for the napkin on his lap. He then hammers nails into his wooden left hand, bending them so they can hold his fork. As the gourmet prepeares to eat, his meal is revealed to be his missing hand, which he proceeds to cut into after removing his wedding ring.

Such phrases are both preceded and followed by a comma, unless that would result in a doubling of punctuation marks or the parenthetical is at the start or end of the sentence. The following are examples of types of parenthetical phrases: *Introductory phrase: Once upon a time, my father ate a muffin.Garner's Modern American Usage, (Oxford: 2003, p. 655) *Interjection: My father ate the muffin, gosh darn it! *Aside: My father, if you don't mind me telling you this, ate the muffin. *Appositive: My father, a jaded and bitter man, ate the muffin. *Absolute phrase: My father, his eyes flashing with rage, ate the muffin. *Free modifier: My father, chewing with unbridled fury, ate the muffin. *Resumptive modifier: My father ate the muffin, a muffin which no man had yet chewed. *Summative modifier: My father ate the muffin, a feat which no man had attempted. The parenthesization of phrases may change the connotation, reducing or eliminating ambiguity. In the following example, the thing in the first sentence that is relaxing is the cool day, whereas in the second sentence it is the walk, since the introduction of commas makes \"on a cool day\" parenthetical: :They took a walk on a cool day that was relaxing. :They took a walk, on\n\nID: 4\nTitle: The Party (1968 film)\nContent: to serve dinner and fights with the other staff.

Levinson ends up brawling with other waiting staff, and dinner is disrupted. Hrundi apologizes to his hosts; then needs to go to the bathroom. He wanders through the house, opening doors and barging in on various servants and guests in embarrassing situations. He ends up in the backyard, where he accidentally sets off the irrigation sprinklers. At Divot's insistence, Michèle gives an impromptu guitar performance of \"Nothing to Lose\" to impress the guests. Hrundi goes upstairs, where he saves Michèle from Divot's unwanted advances by dislodging Divot's toupee. Hrundi finally finds a bathroom, but he breaks the toilet, drops a painting in it, gets toilet paper everywhere, and floods the bathroom.

Scrambling of constituents was common. Even sometimes scrambling within a constituent occurred, as in Beowulf line 708 wrāþum on andan: wrāþum on andan hostile (Dative Singular) on/with malice (Dative Singular) \"with hostile malice\" Something similar occurs in line 713 in sele þām hēan \"in the high hall\" (lit. \"in hall the high\"). Extraposition of constituents out of larger constituents is common even in prose, as in the well-known tale of Cynewulf and Cyneheard, which begins :Hēr Cynewulf benam Sigebryht his rīces ond westseaxna wiotan for unryhtum dǣdum, būton Hamtūnscīre; ... :(Literally) \"Here Cynewulf deprived Sigebryht of his kingdom _and West Saxons' counselors_ for unright deeds, except Hampshire\" :(translated) \"Here Cynewulf and the West Saxon counselors deprived Sigebryht of his kingdom, other than Hampshire, for unjust actions\" The words ond westseaxna wiotan \"and the West Saxon counselors\" (lit. \"and (the) counselors of (the) West Saxons\") have been extraposed from (moved out of) the compound subject they belong in, in a way that would be impossible in modern English. In Old English, case inflection preserves the meaning: the verb beniman \"to deprive\" (appearing in this sentence in the form benam, \"[he] deprived\") needs a word in the genitive case to show what someone or something is deprived of, which in this sentence is rīces \"of kingdom\" (nominative\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Evaluate this sentence for spelling and grammar mistakes: He finnished his meal and left the resturant.\n\n[/INST]IDs: </s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

Île-de-France is densely populated and retains a prime economic position on the national stage: though it covers only , about 2% of metropolitan French territory, its 2017 population was nearly one-fifth of the national total. The region is made up of eight administrative departments: Paris, Essonne, Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis, Seine-et- Marne, Val-de-Marne, Val-d'Oise and Yvelines. It was created as the \"District of the Paris Region\" in 1961. In 1976, when its status was aligned with the French administrative regions created in 1972, it was renamed after the historic province of Île-de-France. Residents are sometimes referred to as Franciliens, an administrative word created in the 1980s. The GDP of the region in 2019 was nearly one-third of the French, and 5% of the European Union's. It has the highest per capita GDP of any French region and the third highest of any region in the European Union.

Historically, the city was the capital of the County of Blois, created on 832 until its integration into the Royal domain in 1498, when Count Louis II of Orléans became King Louis XII of France. During the Renaissance, Blois was the official residence of the King of France. ==History== === Pre-history === Since 2013, excavations have been conducted by French National Institute of Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP in French) in Vienne where they found evidence of \"one or several camps of late Prehistory hunter-gatherers, who were also fishermen since fishing traps were found there..

At that time, the town was located on the road linking Chartres to Bourges. In the network of cities of the Carnutes people, Blois was a secondary settlement. Excavations carried out on the right bank between 2001 and 2016 and on the left bank in 2013-2014 revealed the presence of a largely developed town on the right bank and an occupation on the left bank during the Gallic and Gallo-Roman periods.

The suburbs of St. Christophe and Déols lie on the right bank of the Indre. The castle from which the city takes its name was built in the latter part of the 10th century by Raoul, prince of Déols. From 920 to 1008, the Norman raids forced the monks of the abbey of Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys, founded in Brittany by Saint Gildas, to bring his relics to the abbey of Saint-Gildas of Châteauroux that they founded under the protection of the prince Ebbes of Déols, father of Raoul. During the Middle Ages it was the seat of a seigniory. It was passed to the Chauvigny from 1207 to 1473. It was raised to the rank of countship in 1497 for Jean V d'Aumont. In 1616, when it was held by Henry II, Prince of Condé, it was raised to the rank of duchy. In 1736 it returned to the crown. It was given to Marie Anne de Mailly-Nesle, duchess of Châteauroux, by Louis XV in 1744.

The Ten Essentials first appeared in print in the third edition of Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills (January 1974). Many regional organizations and authors recommend that hikers, backpackers, and climbers rigorously ensure they have the ten essentials with them. However, personal preferences and differences in conditions may dictate otherwise and with experience most adventurers add and subtract from the list depending on the situation. Some ultralight backpackers do not always carry all of the items and believe it is an acceptable risk they take in order to travel light and fast. ==List== The ninth edition of Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills, published in 2017, defines the Ten Essentials as: # Navigation: map, altimeter, compass, GPS device, personal locator beacon # Headlamp: with LED bulb and spare batteries # Sun protection: sunglasses, sun protective clothing, sunscreen # First aid: a first aid kit, wrapped in waterproof packaging # Knife: hikers on a short trip may also carry a multi-tool, strong adhesive tape and cordage; on a longer trip, further small tools may be useful # Fire: the means to both start and sustain a fire; either a butane lighter or matches, or other fire making device.

The list, now known as “The Classic List,” first appeared in print in 1974 with the publication of the third edition of Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills. The list was developed so that outdoor recreationists could respond to an accident, or spend an unforeseen night in the wild. Over time The Mountaineers have tweaked the list to reflect the availability of modern gear. Now known as the “Ten Essential Systems,” the club recommends that outdoor recreationists carry the following, as needed according to the situation: * Navigation (map & compass) * Sun protection (sunglasses & sunscreen) * Insulation (extra clothing) * Illumination (headlamp/flashlight) * First-aid supplies * Fire (waterproof matches/lighter/candle) * Repair kit and tools * Nutrition (extra food) * Hydration (extra water) * Emergency shelter (tent/plastic tube tent/garbage bag) ==Carrying methods and capacity== thumb|A smaller knife that may be worn on a neck-lanyard A pack's capacity to carry items is determined by: * Carrying methods on the body * Bag volume * Construction strength, design, materials, and construction quality Commonly- used carrying methods include: * A wristband, belt loop, a thin neck lanyard, and clothing pockets are among the smaller, lighter methods. * A small belt pouch (60 cu.in., 1 liter) that can attach to a belt * A bodypack or tactical vest (100–200 cu.in.) is a load-bearing vest, and may\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Camping\nContent: be carried on one's person. This kit is useless in these circumstances if it is kept in the backpack that is left in camp. Such a kit should include a small metal container which can be used to heat water over a campfire, a small length of duct tape which can prove useful in many situations, and an emergency space blanket. These blankets are specially designed to occupy minimal space and are perfect for making emergency shelters, keeping the camper warm. Also because of the aluminum-like color this blanket is reflective which means it can be easily seen from an aircraft. Candle stubs are good in starting a fire as well as in warming an enclosed space. One or two band-aids are mandatory in this type of camping. Any camper, and not only the survival ones, need waterproof matches or a lighter and a large safety pin or fish hook which can be used in fishing. Rubber gloves, antiseptic wipes, tinfoil, jackknife, or halazone tablets (which purify the water) are also to be included into a survival kit. Although these seem too many items to be carried on one person, they are in fact small, lightweight and definitely useful.

However, with correct precautions, even fairly adventurous outdoor recreation can be enjoyable and safe. == General safety measures == Every hazard has its own safety measure, and every ailment a particular remedy. A standard precaution for all back country activities is carrying the \"ten essentials\", a collection of tools chosen for their utility in preventing or reacting to various emergencies. The common practice of traveling in a group improves safety in all regards. If one person is injured, group members can administer first aid or seek help. A group can avoid poor decisions that a lone traveler might make. If an emergency occurs, a group can pool its muscle power, brain power, and body heat. Another precaution is informing people outside of the group of the itinerary and expected return time (expected hiking time can be estimated using Naismith's rule). A communication device, such as a cell phone or a satellite phone, may help in the case of an emergency. However, with the exception of mountain tops that are in line-of-sight to populated areas, cell phone coverage in wilderness areas is often quite poor. In the wilderness one should always be prepared to hike out for help, if necessary. == Dangerous circumstances == ===Inclement weather=== Blizzards, flash floods, fog, dust or sandstorms, tornadoes, and other meteorological events may or may not be predictable, and may require immediate response for survival.

The causes of the Great Depression in the early 20th century in the United States have been extensively discussed by economists and remain a matter of active debate. They are part of the larger debate about economic crises and recessions. The specific economic events that took place during the Great Depression are well established. There was an initial stock market crash that triggered a \"panic sell-off\" of assets. This was followed by a deflation in asset and commodity prices, dramatic drops in demand and the total quantity of money in the economy, and disruption of trade, ultimately resulting in widespread unemployment (over 13 million people were unemployed by 1932) and impoverishment. However, economists and historians have not reached a consensus on the causal relationships between various events and government economic policies in causing or ameliorating the Depression. Current mainstream theories may be broadly classified into two main points of view. The first are the demand-driven theories, from Keynesian and institutional economists who argue that the depression was caused by a widespread loss of confidence that led to drastically lower investment and persistent underconsumption. The demand-driven theories argue that the financial crisis following the 1929 crash led to a sudden and persistent reduction in consumption and investment spending, causing the depression that followed. Once panic and deflation set in, many people believed they could avoid further losses by keeping clear of the markets. Holding money therefore became profitable as prices dropped lower and a given amount of money bought ever more goods, exacerbating the drop in demand. Second, there are the monetarists, who believe that the Great Depression started as an ordinary recession, but that significant policy\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Causes of the Great Depression\nContent: Depression started as an ordinary recession, but that significant policy mistakes by monetary authorities (especially the Federal Reserve) caused a shrinking of the money supply which greatly exacerbated the economic situation, causing a recession to descend into the Great Depression. Related to this explanation are those who point to debt deflation causing those who borrow to owe ever more in real terms. There are also several various heterodox theories that reject the explanations of the Keynesians and monetarists. Some new classical macroeconomists have argued that various labor market policies imposed at the start caused the length and severity of the Great Depression. ==General theoretical reasoning== The two classical competing theories of the Great Depression are the Keynesian (demand-driven) and the monetarist explanation. There are also various heterodox theories that downplay or reject the explanations of the Keynesians and monetarists. Economists and economic historians are almost evenly split as to whether the traditional monetary explanation that monetary forces were the primary cause of the Great Depression is right, or the traditional Keynesian explanation that a fall in autonomous spending, particularly investment, is the primary explanation for the onset of the Great Depression.Robert Whaples, \"Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians? The Results of a Survey on Forty Propositions\", Journal of Economic History, Vol. 55, No. 1 (March 1995), p. 150 in JSTOR. Today the controversy is of lesser importance since there is mainstream support for the debt deflation theory and the expectations hypothesis that building on the monetary explanation of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz add non-monetary explanations. There is consensus that the Federal Reserve System should have cut short the process of monetary deflation and banking collapse.

Sectors of the US economy had been showing some signs of distress for months before October 1929. Business inventories of all types were three times as large as they had been a year before (an indication that the public was not buying products as rapidly as in the past), and other signposts of economic health—freight carloads, industrial production, and wholesale prices—were slipping downward. The events in the United States triggered a worldwide depression, which led to deflation and a great increase in unemployment. In the United States between 1929 and 1933, unemployment soared from 3% of the workforce to 25%, while manufacturing output collapsed by one-third. Local relief was overwhelmed. Unable to support their families, many unemployed men deserted (often going to \"Hoovervilles\") so the meager relief supplies their families received would stretch further. For many, their next meal was found at a soup kitchen, if at all. Adding to the misery of the times, drought arrived in the Great Plains. Decades of bad farming practices caused the topsoil to erode, and combined with the weather conditions (the 1930s was the overall warmest decade of the 20th century in North America) caused an ecological disaster. The dry soil was lifted by wind and blown into huge dust storms that blanketed entire towns, a phenomenon that continued for several years. Those who had lost their homes and livelihoods in the Dust Bowl were lured westward\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Causes of the Great Depression\nContent: as being in opposition to Say's Law. The idea that reduced capital investment was a cause of the depression is a central theme in secular stagnation theory. Keynes argued that if the national government spent more money to help the economy to recover the money normally spent by consumers and business firms, then unemployment rates would fall. The solution was for the Federal Reserve System to \"create new money for the national government to borrow and spend\" and to cut taxes rather than raising them, in order for consumers to spend more, and other beneficial factors.Caldwell, J., & O'Driscoll, T. G. (2007). What Caused the Great Depression?. Social Education, 71(2), 70-74 Hoover chose to do the opposite of what Keynes thought to be the solution and allowed the federal government to raise taxes exceedingly to reduce the budget shortage brought upon by the depression. Keynes proclaimed that more workers could be employed by decreasing interest rates, encouraging firms to borrow more money and make more products. Employment would prevent the government from having to spend any more money by increasing the amount at which consumers would spend. Keynes' theory was then confirmed by the length of the Great Depression within the United States and the constant unemployment rate. Employment rates began to rise in preparation for World War II by increasing government spending. \"In light of these developments, the Keynesian explanation of the Great Depression was increasingly accepted by economists, historians, and politicians\". ====Monetarist==== thumb|The Great Depression in a monetary view. In their 1963 book A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960, Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz laid out their case for a different explanation of the Great Depression. Essentially, the Great Depression, in their view, was caused by the fall of\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Causes of the Great Depression\nContent: into consumer purchases. Thus workers did not have enough income to absorb the large amount of capacity that had been added. According to this view, the root cause of the Great Depression was a global overinvestment while the level of wages and earnings from independent businesses fell short of creating enough purchasing power. It was argued that government should intervene by an increased taxation of the rich to help make income more equal. With the increased revenue the government could create public works to increase employment and 'kick start' the economy. In the U.S.A. the economic policies had been quite the opposite until 1932. The Revenue Act of 1932 and public works programmes introduced in Hoover's last year as president and taken up by Roosevelt, created some redistribution of purchasing power.The Road to Plenty (1928) The stock market crash made it evident that banking systems Americans were relying on were not dependable. Americans looked towards insubstantial banking units for their own liquidity supply. As the economy began to fail, these banks were no longer able to support those who depended on their assets – they did not hold as much power as the larger banks. During the depression, \"three waves of bank failures shook the economy.\"Chapter 15: The Great Depression. (1999). Growth of the International Economy 1820–2000 (pp. 226–34). Taylor & Francis Ltd / Books. The first wave came just when the economy was heading in the direction of recovery at the end of 1930 and the beginning of 1931. The second wave of bank failures occurred \"after the Federal Reserve System raised the rediscount rate to stanch an outflow of gold\" around the end of 1931. The last wave, which began in the middle of 1932, was the worst and most devastating, continuing\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Causes of the Great Depression\nContent: Depression, in their view, was caused by the fall of the money supply. Friedman and Schwartz write: \"From the cyclical peak in August 1929 to a cyclical trough in March 1933, the stock of money fell by over a third.\" The result was what Friedman and Schwartz called \"The Great Contraction\" — a period of falling income, prices, and employment caused by the choking effects of a restricted money supply. Friedman and Schwartz argue that people wanted to hold more money than the Federal Reserve was supplying. As a result, people hoarded money by consuming less. This caused a contraction in employment and production since prices were not flexible enough to immediately fall. The Fed's failure was in not realizing what was happening and not taking corrective action.Paul Krugman (February 3, 2007), \"Who Was Milton Friedman?\", New York Review of Books In a speech honoring Friedman and Schwartz, Ben Bernanke stated: > \"Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official > representative of the Federal Reserve.

The nadir came in 1931–1933, and recovery came in 1940. The stock market crash marked the beginning of a decade of high unemployment, poverty, low profits, deflation, plunging farm incomes, and lost opportunities for economic growth as well as for personal advancement. Altogether, there was a general loss of confidence in the economic future. The usual explanations include numerous factors, especially high consumer debt, ill-regulated markets that permitted overoptimistic loans by banks and investors, and the lack of high-growth new industries. These all interacted to create a downward economic spiral of reduced spending, falling confidence and lowered production. Industries that suffered the most included construction, shipping, mining, logging, and agriculture. Also hard hit was the manufacturing of durable goods like automobiles and appliances, whose purchase consumers could postpone. The economy hit bottom in the winter of 1932–1933; then came four years of growth until the recession of 1937–1938 brought back high levels of unemployment.Chandler (1970); Jensen (1989); Mitchell (1964) thumb|upright=1.5|US annual real GDP from 1910 to 1960, with the years of the Great Depression (1929–1939) highlighted thumb|300px|Unemployment rate in the US 1910–60, with the years of the Great Depression (1929–39) highlighted; accurate data begins in 1939, represented by a blue line. The Depression caused major political changes in America. Three years into the depression, President Herbert Hoover, widely blamed for not doing enough to combat the crisis, lost the election of 1932 to Franklin Delano Roosevelt by a landslide. Roosevelt's economic recovery plan, the New Deal, instituted unprecedented programs for relief, recovery and reform, and brought about a major realignment of politics with liberalism dominant and\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Great Depression in the United States\nContent: about a major realignment of politics with liberalism dominant and conservatism in retreat until 1938.

The memory of the Depression also shaped modern theories of government and economics and resulted in many changes in how the government dealt with economic downturns, such as the use of stimulus packages, Keynesian economics, and Social Security. It also shaped modern American literature, resulting in famous novels such as John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men. ==Causes== ===Monetary interpretations=== Examining the causes of the Great Depression raises multiple issues: what factors set off the first downturn in 1929; what structural weaknesses and specific events turned it into a major depression; how the downturn spread from country to country; and why the economic recovery was so prolonged. Many rural banks began to fail in October 1930 when farmers defaulted on loans. There was no federal deposit insurance during that time as bank failures were considered a normal part of economic life. Worried depositors started to withdraw savings, so the money multiplier worked in reverse. Banks were forced to liquidate assets (such as calling in loans rather than creating new loans).Robert Fuller (2012), Phantom of Fear: The Banking Panic of 1933, pp. 241–42 fn. 45 This caused the money supply to shrink and the economy to contract (the Great Contraction), resulting in a significant decline in aggregate investment.

The apex predator like the lion, could move vigorously, and has powerful senses like keen eyesight and the ability to smell their prey from a distance, while a lower order of animals might wiggle or crawl, or like oysters were sessile, attached to the sea-bed. All, however, share the senses of touch and taste. ===Plants=== Plants lacked sense organs and the ability to move, but they could grow and reproduce. The highest plants have important healing attributes within their leaves, buds, and flowers. A lower classification of plants would be mushrooms, and moss, or any of that belonging to the Fungus kingdom. ===Minerals=== At the bottom of the chain, minerals were unable to move, sense, grow, or reproduce. Their attributes were being solid and strong, while the gemstones possessed magic. The king of gems was the diamond. ==Natural science== ===From Aristotle to Linnaeus=== The basic idea of a ranking of the world's organisms goes back to Aristotle's biology. In his History of Animals, where he ranked animals over plants based on their ability to move and sense, and graded the animals by their reproductive mode, live birth being \"higher\" than laying cold eggs, and possession of blood, warm-blooded mammals and birds again being \"higher\" than \"bloodless\" invertebrates. Aristotle's non-religious concept of higher and lower organisms was taken up by natural philosophers during the Scholastic period to form the basis of the Scala Naturae. The scala allowed for an ordering of beings, thus forming a basis for classification where each kind of mineral, plant and animal could be slotted into place. In medieval times, the great chain was seen as a God-given and unchangeable ordering. In the Northern Renaissance, the scientific focus shifted to biology;\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Aristotle\nContent: a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice. ==== Classification of living things ==== Aristotle distinguished about 500 species of animals, arranging these in the History of Animals in a graded scale of perfection, a nonreligious version of the scala naturae, with man at the top. His system had eleven grades of animal, from highest potential to lowest, expressed in their form at birth: the highest gave live birth to hot and wet creatures, the lowest laid cold, dry mineral-like eggs. Animals came above plants, and these in turn were above minerals. He grouped what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates as the hotter \"animals with blood\", and below them the colder invertebrates as \"animals without blood\". Those with blood were divided into the live-bearing (mammals), and the egg-laying (birds, reptiles, fish). Those without blood were insects, crustacea (non-shelled – cephalopods, and shelled) and the hard-shelled molluscs (bivalves and gastropods). He recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale, and noted various exceptions, such as that sharks had a placenta like the tetrapods. To a modern biologist, the explanation, not available to Aristotle, is convergent evolution. Philosophers of science have generally concluded that Aristotle was not interested in taxonomy, but zoologists who studied this question in the early 21st century think otherwise. He believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes; this teleological view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design.

He has also published a number of books (Floras) devoted to the systematics of plants found in particular regions. These include a 1966 book on the native shrubs of Southern California; a 1966 flora on the Santa Monica Mountains in California; and, with various editors and authors, an ongoing 33 volume set (to date) on the flora of China, organized by plant family. === Ethnobotany === Raven (along with Dennis E. Breedlove) was a collaborator on a team led by Brent Berlin that published a seminal work on the classification of plants by the Tzeltal Mayan-speaking people of Highland Chiapas. They concluded that plant, as well as animal, descriptions could be grouped into five different hierarchical \"taxonomic ethnobiological categories\"; these included 1.) \"unique beginner,\" such as plants and animals, 2.) \"life form\", such as tree, vine, bird, grass, mammal, etc.; 3.) the largest category, consisting usually of ~500 taxa, is \"generic\", and consists of names such as oak, pine, catfish, perch, and robin. Further, some \"generics\" were not included with in the classification of \"life forms\", and were called \"aberrant\". These included names such as cactus, bamboo, pineapple, platypus, etc., and were often of economic value—Agave, bean, and corn as examples. Two other taxa were called \"specific\" and \"varietal,\" and were generally less numerous. Examples of \"specific\" include blue spruce, white fir, and post oak, and examples of \"varietal\" included baby beans, button beans, etc. Berlin, Breedlove and Raven later extended their analysis of plants and animals to other indigenous peoples including the Hanunoo speaking people of the island of Mindoro, Philippines; the Karam of Papua New Guinea; the Cantonese speaking boat people of\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Evolutionary anachronism\nContent: dwarf palm Chamaerops humilis Southwest Mediterranean Successful seed dispersal by introduced feral goats and European pine martens in the Balearic Islands.

In plant taxonomy, the highest level is not a \"unique beginner\" but is instead represented by four major lexemes or units. These four levels are trees, vines, grasses, and herbs. There are more minor classes that include cacti, agaves, bamboos, etc. There are also very few midlevel plant categories. All of the Tzeltal specific taxa (those that which include no other members) fall into the different major and minor sublevels in their taxonomy. But, it is odd to note that the midlevel category hihte, or \"oak\", contains the plants sikyok and cikinib which neither share the same linguistic structure with their \"parent plant.\" To test the hypothesis they first went through the community, observed, and recorded information from their informants comments of the plants in their natural habitats. When they went out into the field to collect data, they noticed that some of 10,000 specimens that were located in the same named contrast set were closely related than others. They take into account the uses of the certain plants including food, herbs, firewood and so on. A second method that was used helped with searching for possible subgroupings within contrast sets of large numbers was to determine the extent to which informants subdivided lists of plant names. To do this, they wrote the names of different names of plants and animals on slips of papers and then gave them to their informants. After doing this, the informants then put the slips of papers into groups that were most like each other. The results showed that they had no trouble placing them in the different categories of \"plants\" and \"animals.\" This also showed that though they\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Bucovăț, Timiș\nContent: flora, the collection comprising a number of 800 taxa.

The embedding is used in text analysis. Typically, the representation is a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of the word in such a way that words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning. Word embeddings can be obtained using language modeling and feature learning techniques, where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers. Methods to generate this mapping include neural networks, dimensionality reduction on the word co-occurrence matrix, probabilistic models, explainable knowledge base method, and explicit representation in terms of the context in which words appear. Word and phrase embeddings, when used as the underlying input representation, have been shown to boost the performance in NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing and sentiment analysis. ==Development and history of the approach== In distributional semantics, a quantitative methodological approach to understanding meaning in observed language, word embeddings or semantic vector space models have been used as a knowledge representation for some time. Such models aim to quantify and categorize semantic similarities between linguistic items based on their distributional properties in large samples of language data. The underlying idea that \"a word is characterized by the company it keeps\" was proposed in a 1957 article by John Rupert Firth, Reprinted in but also has roots in the contemporaneous work on search systems} and in cognitive psychology. The notion of a semantic space with lexical items (words or multi-word terms) represented as vectors or embeddings is based on the computational challenges of capturing distributional characteristics and using them for practical application to measure similarity between words, phrases, or entire documents. The first generation of semantic space\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Sentence embedding\nContent: text: Sentence embedding is the collective name for a set of techniques in natural language processing (NLP) where sentences are mapped to vectors of real numbers.Paper Summary: Evaluation of sentence embeddings in downstream and linguistic probing tasksThe Current Best of Universal Word Embeddings and Sentence EmbeddingsSanjeev Arora, Yingyu Liang, and Tengyu Ma. \"A simple but tough-to-beat baseline for sentence embeddings.\", 2016; openreview:SyK00v5xx. == Application == Sentence embedding is used by the deep learning software libraries PyTorch and TensorFlow. Popular embeddings are based on the hidden layer outputs of transformer models like BERT, see SBERT. An alternative direction is to aggregate word embeddings, such those returned by Word2vec, into sentence embeddings. The most straightforward approach is to simply compute the average of word vectors, known as continuous bag-of-words (CBOW). However, more elaborate solutions based on word vector quantization have also been proposed. One such approach is the vector of locally aggregated word embeddings (VLAWE), which demonstrated performance improvements in downstream text classification tasks. == Evaluation == A way of testing sentence encodings is to apply them on Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge (SICK) corpusMarco Marelli, Stefano Menini, Marco Baroni, Luisa Bentivogli, Raffaella Bernardi, and Roberto Zamparelli. \"A SICK cure for the evaluation of compositional distributional semantic models.\" In LREC, pp. 216-223. 2014 . for both entailment (SICK-E) and relatedness (SICK-R).

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) are both used to reduce the dimensionality of word vector spaces and visualize word embeddings and clusters. ===Examples of application=== For instance, the fastText is also used to calculate word embeddings for text corpora in Sketch Engine that are available online. == Ethical implications == Word embeddings may contain the biases and stereotypes contained in the trained dataset, as Bolukbasi et al. points out in the 2016 paper “Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings” that a publicly available (and popular) word2vec embedding trained on Google News texts (a commonly used data corpus), which consists of text written by professional journalists, still shows disproportionate word associations reflecting gender and racial biases when extracting word analogies (Bolukbasi et al. 2016). For example, one of the analogies generated using the aforementioned word embedding is “man is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker”.

These models learn the embeddings by leveraging statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms. Here are some commonly used embedding models: # Word2Vec: Word2Vec is a popular embedding model used in natural language processing (NLP). It learns word embeddings by training a neural network on a large corpus of text. Word2Vec captures semantic and syntactic relationships between words, allowing for meaningful computations like word analogies. # GloVe: GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) is another widely used embedding model for NLP. It combines global statistical information from a corpus with local context information to learn word embeddings. GloVe embeddings are known for capturing both semantic and relational similarities between words. # Siamese Networks: Siamese networks are a type of neural network architecture commonly used for similarity-based embedding. They consist of two identical subnetworks that process two input samples and produce their respective embeddings. Siamese networks are often used for tasks like image similarity, recommendation systems, and face recognition. # Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): VAEs are generative models that simultaneously learn to encode and decode data. The latent space in VAEs acts as an embedding space. By training VAEs on high-dimensional data, such as images or audio, the model learns to encode the data into a compact latent representation. VAEs are known for their ability to generate new data samples from the learned latent space. == Multimodality == Multimodality refers to the integration and analysis of multiple modes or types of data within a single model or framework.

Most approaches that produce multi-sense embeddings can be divided into two main categories for their word sense representation, i.e., unsupervised and knowledge-based. Based on word2vec skip-gram, Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (MSSG) performs word-sense discrimination and embedding simultaneously, improving its training time, while assuming a specific number of senses for each word. In the Non- Parametric Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (NP-MSSG) this number can vary depending on each word. Combining the prior knowledge of lexical databases (e.g., WordNet, ConceptNet, BabelNet), word embeddings and word sense disambiguation, Most Suitable Sense Annotation (MSSA) labels word-senses through an unsupervised and knowledge-based approach, considering a word's context in a pre-defined sliding window. Once the words are disambiguated, they can be used in a standard word embeddings technique, so multi-sense embeddings are produced. MSSA architecture allows the disambiguation and annotation process to be performed recurrently in a self-improving manner. The use of multi-sense embeddings is known to improve performance in several NLP tasks, such as part- of-speech tagging, semantic relation identification, semantic relatedness, named entity recognition and sentiment analysis. As of the late 2010s, contextually-meaningful embeddings such as ELMo and BERT have been developed. Unlike static word embeddings, these embeddings are at the token-level, in that each occurrence of a word has its own embedding. These embeddings better reflect the multi-sense nature of words, because occurrences of a word in similar contexts are situated in similar regions of BERT’s embedding space.Lucy, Li, and David Bamman. \"Characterizing English variation across social media communities\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Deep learning\nContent: Transfer capturing the style of a given artwork and applying it in a visually pleasing manner to an arbitrary photograph or video *generating striking imagery based on random visual input fields. === Natural language processing === Neural networks have been used for implementing language models since the early 2000s. LSTM helped to improve machine translation and language modeling. Other key techniques in this field are negative sampling and word embedding. Word embedding, such as word2vec, can be thought of as a representational layer in a deep learning architecture that transforms an atomic word into a positional representation of the word relative to other words in the dataset; the position is represented as a point in a vector space. Using word embedding as an RNN input layer allows the network to parse sentences and phrases using an effective compositional vector grammar. A compositional vector grammar can be thought of as probabilistic context free grammar (PCFG) implemented by an RNN. Recursive auto-encoders built atop word embeddings can assess sentence similarity and detect paraphrasing. Deep neural architectures provide the best results for constituency parsing, sentiment analysis, information retrieval, spoken language understanding, machine translation, contextual entity linking, writing style recognition, named-entity recognition (token classification), text classification, and others. Recent developments generalize word embedding to sentence embedding. Google Translate (GT) uses a large end-to-end long short-term memory (LSTM) network. Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) uses an example-based machine translation method in which the system \"learns from millions of examples.\" It translates \"whole sentences at a time, rather than pieces\". Google Translate supports over one hundred languages. The network encodes the \"semantics of the sentence rather than simply memorizing phrase-to-phrase translations\". GT uses English as an intermediate between most language\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Word2vec\nContent: According to the authors' note, CBOW is faster while skip-gram does a better job for infrequent words. After the model has trained, the learned word embeddings are positioned in the vector space such that words that share common contexts in the corpus — that is, words that are semantically and syntactically similar — are located close to one another in the space. More dissimilar words are located farther from one another in the space. This occurs because words which influence relative word probabilities in similar ways will have learned similar embeddings once the model has finished. For example, consider the CBOW framework, which can be thought of as a ‘fill in the blank’ task. The learned embedding for a word will represent the way in which, when that word appears in a context window, it influences the relative probabilities of other words appearing in the ‘blank,’ or the position at the center of the context window. Therefore, words which are semantically similar should influence these probabilities in similar ways, because semantically similar words should be used in similar contexts. ==History== In 2010, Tomáš Mikolov (then at Brno University of Technology) with co-authors applied a simple recurrent neural network with a single hidden layer to language modelling.https://gwern.net/doc/ai/nn/rnn/2010-mikolov.pdf Word2vec was created, patented, and published in 2013 by a team of researchers led by Mikolov at Google over two papers. Other researchers helped analyse and explain the algorithm. Embedding vectors created using the Word2vec algorithm have some advantages compared to earlier algorithms such as latent semantic analysis. By 2022, the Word2vec approach was described as \"dated\", with transformer models being regarded as the state of the art in NLP. == Parameterization == Results of word2vec\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Explain the use of word embeddings in Natural Language Processing\n\n[/INST]IDs: 0, 1, 2, 6</s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

Additionally, nearly all motherboards include logic and connectors to support commonly used input devices, such as USB for mouse devices and keyboards. Early personal computers such as the Apple II or IBM PC included only this minimal peripheral support on the motherboard. Occasionally video interface hardware was also integrated into the motherboard; for example, on the Apple II and rarely on IBM-compatible computers such as the IBM PC Jr. Additional peripherals such as disk controllers and serial ports were provided as expansion cards. Given the high thermal design power of high-speed computer CPUs and components, modern motherboards nearly always include heat sinks and mounting points for fans to dissipate excess heat. ===Form factor=== Motherboards are produced in a variety of sizes and shapes called form factors, some of which are specific to individual computer manufacturers. However, the motherboards used in IBM- compatible systems are designed to fit various case sizes. , most desktop computer motherboards use the ATX standard form factor — even those found in Macintosh\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Computer hardware\nContent: a nonvolatile BIOS memory chip, which stores data on floating-gate MOSFET memory cells. ** The BIOS (Basic Input Output System) includes boot firmware and power management firmware. Newer motherboards use Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) instead of BIOS. *Buses that connect the CPU to various internal components and to expand cards for graphics and sound. * The CMOS (complementary MOS) battery, which powers the CMOS memory for date and time in the BIOS chip. This battery is generally a watch battery. * The video card (also known as the graphics card), which processes computer graphics. More powerful graphics cards are better suited to handle strenuous tasks, such as playing intensive video games or running computer graphics software. A video card contains a graphics processing unit (GPU) and video memory (typically a type of SDRAM), both fabricated on MOS integrated circuit (MOS IC) chips. *Power MOSFETs make up the voltage regulator module (VRM), which controls how much voltage other hardware components receive. ====Expansion cards==== An expansion card in computing is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an expansion slot of a computer motherboard or backplane to add functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus. Expansion cards can be used to obtain or expand on features not offered by the motherboard. ====Storage devices==== A storage device is any computing hardware and digital media that is used for storing, porting and extracting data files and objects. It can hold and store information both temporarily and permanently and can be internal or external to a computer, server or any similar computing device. Data storage is a core function and fundamental component of computers. Dedicated storage devices include RAIDs and tape libraries. =====Fixed media===== Data is\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Motherboard\nContent: are plugged; In very old designs, copper wires were the discrete connections between card connector pins, but printed circuit boards soon became the standard practice. The central processing unit (CPU), memory, and peripherals were housed on individually printed circuit boards, which were plugged into the backplane. In older microprocessor-based systems, the CPU and some support circuitry would fit on a single CPU board, with memory and peripherals on additional boards, all plugged into the backplane. The ubiquitous S-100 bus of the 1970s is an example of this type of backplane system. The most popular computers of the 1980s such as the Apple II and IBM PC had published schematic diagrams and other documentation which permitted rapid reverse-engineering and third-party replacement motherboards. Usually intended for building new computers compatible with the exemplars, many motherboards offered additional performance or other features and were used to upgrade the manufacturer's original equipment. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, it became economical to move an increasing number of peripheral functions onto the motherboard. In the late 1980s, personal computer motherboards began to include single ICs (also called Super I/O chips) capable of supporting a set of low-speed peripherals: PS/2 keyboard and mouse, floppy disk drive, serial ports, and parallel ports. By the late 1990s, many personal computer motherboards included consumer-grade embedded audio, video, storage, and networking functions without the need for any expansion cards at all; higher-end systems for 3D gaming and computer graphics typically retained only the graphics card as a separate component. Business PCs, workstations, and servers were more likely to need expansion cards, either for more robust functions, or for higher speeds; those systems often had fewer embedded components.

The motherboard has a miniITX formfactor and contains a single Elbrus-2C+ microprocessor with a clock frequency of 500 MHz. The memory controller provides a dual-channel memory mode. The board has two DDR2-800 memory slots, which enables up to 16 GB of RAM memory (using ECC modules). It also supports expansion boards using PCI Express x16 bus. In addition there is an on-board Gigabit Ethernet interface, 4 USB 2.0, RS-232 interface, DVI connector and audio input/output ports. ==References== Category:Motherboard Category:Embedded systems\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Peripheral Component Interconnect\nContent: text: Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI). is a local computer bus for attaching hardware devices in a computer and is part of the PCI Local Bus standard. The PCI bus supports the functions found on a processor bus but in a standardized format that is independent of any given processor's native bus. Devices connected to the PCI bus appear to a bus master to be connected directly to its own bus and are assigned addresses in the processor's address space. It is a parallel bus, synchronous to a single bus clock. Attached devices can take either the form of an integrated circuit fitted onto the motherboard (called a planar device in the PCI specification) or an expansion card that fits into a slot. The PCI Local Bus was first implemented in IBM PC compatibles, where it displaced the combination of several slow Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) slots and one fast VESA Local Bus (VLB) slot as the bus configuration. It has subsequently been adopted for other computer types. Typical PCI cards used in PCs include: network cards, sound cards, modems, extra ports such as Universal Serial Bus (USB) or serial, TV tuner cards and hard disk drive host adapters. PCI video cards replaced ISA and VLB cards until rising bandwidth needs outgrew the abilities of PCI. The preferred interface for video cards then became Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP), a superset of PCI, before giving way to PCI Express. The first version of PCI found in retail desktop computers was a 32-bit bus using a 33 MHz bus clock and 5 V signaling, although the PCI 1.0 standard provided for a 64-bit variant as well. These have one locating notch in the card. Version 2.0 of the PCI standard introduced 3.3 V\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Diagnostic board\nContent: text: In electronic systems a diagnostic board is a specialized device with diagnostic circuitry on a printed circuit board that connects to a computer or other electronic equipment replacing an existing module, or plugging into an expansion card slot. A multi-board electronic system such as a computer comprises multiple printed circuit boards or cards connected via connectors. When a fault occurs in the system, it is sometimes possible to isolate or identify the fault by replacing one of the boards with a diagnostic board. A diagnostic board can range from extremely simple to extremely sophisticated. Simple standard diagnostic plug-in boards for computers are available that display numeric codes to assist in identifying issues detected during the power-on self-test executed automatically during system startup. ==Dummy board== A dummy board provides a minimal interface. This type of diagnostic board in intended to confirm that the interface is correctly implemented. For example, a PC motherboard manufacturer can test PCI functionality of a PC motherboard by connecting a dummy PCI board into each PCI slot on the motherboard ==Extender board== An extender board (or board extender, card extender, extender card) is a simple circuit board that interposes between a card cage backplane and the circuit board of interest to physically 'extend' the circuit board of interest out from the card cage allowing access to both sides of the circuit board to connect diagnostic equipment such as an oscilloscope or systems analyzer. For example, a PCI extender board can be plugged into a PCI slot on a computer motherboard, and then a PCI card connected to the extender board to 'extend' the board into free space for access. This approach was common in the 1970s and 1980s particularly on S-100 bus systems. The concept can become unworkable when\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Fairchild F8\nContent: use in their flagship 1/2\" 9-track tape drive the TD1050 series used for billing data interchange by telecom operators. ==Description== ===Chip family=== A typical computer system generally requires a CPU, some form of input/output to communicate with the outside world, and memory holding the program code and user data. Typically, I/O would be handled by dedicated chips, and memory would be accessed through an address bus selecting locations in external memory and then returning that data to the CPU over a data bus. Depending on the design, the I/O would communicate with the processor over a dedicated bus, or alternately by placing data in memory and then having the CPU read it. Moving data between all of these different units required additional \"glue\" circuitry. The F8 was designed to split these duties up in order to make minimalistic implementations possible. In theory, one could place all of these functions on a single chip, but in the era of 40-pin chips there were simply not enough pins to connect all of these functions up. In particular, implementing an 8-bit data bus, 16-bit address bus and another 8-bit I/O bus would leave only 8 more pins for every other function, from power supply and ground to the various clock signals and control lines. Other designs sometimes multiplexed the address and data lines so the same pins could be used for multiple functions, at the cost of requiring more cycles to complete an operation. The F8 addressed this problem by internalizing some of the functions, like adding a small amount of RAM to the CPU core, while moving others out of the CPU. The best example of this is the minimal system consisting of the 3850 CPU and 3851 PSU. In this case, there is no\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Mini-STX\nContent: text: Mini-STX (mSTX, Mini Socket Technology EXtended, originally \"Intel 5x5\") is a computer motherboard form factor that was released by Intel in 2015 (as \"Intel 5x5\"). These motherboards measure 147mm by 140mm (5.8\" x 5.5\"), making them larger than \"4x4\" NUC (102x102mm / 4.01\" x 4.01\" inches) and Nano-ITX (120x120mm / 4.7\" x 4.7\") boards, but notably smaller than the more common Mini-ITX (170x170mm / 6.7\" x 6.7\") boards. Unlike these standards, which use a square shape, the Mini-STX form factor is 7mm longer from front-to-rear, making it slightly rectangular. == Mini-STX design elements == The Mini-STX design suggests (but does not require) support for: * Socketed processors (e.g. LGA or PGA CPUs) * Onboard power regulation circuitry, enabling direct DC power input * IO ports embedded on the front and rear of the motherboard (akin to NUC, but unlike typical motherboards which often use headers instead to connect built-in ports on enclosures) == Adoption by manufacturers == This motherboard form factor is still not in particularly common use with consumer- PC manufacturers, although there are a few offerings: * ASRock offers both DeskMini kits (that use mini-STX boards) and standalone motherboards, * Asus offer VivoMini kits (that use mini-STX boards) and standalone motherboards, * Gigabyte offers a few motherboards, and * industrial PC suppliers (e.g. Kontron, Iesy, ASRock Industrial) also provide some options for mini-STX equipment. == Derivatives == ASRock developed a derivative of mini-STX, dubbed micro-STX, for their 'DeskMini GTX/RX' small form-factor PCs and industrial motherboards.

The Council recommends a governance concept focusing on data sovereignty and makes specific suggestions to (i) realise the potentials of big data, (ii) preserve individual freedom and privacy, (iii) safeguard fairness and solidarity, and (iv) promote responsibility and trust. === Benevolent coercion === In this Opinion, published 1 November 2018, the Council addresses the use of coercive measures in health and social services, including for instance the deprivation of liberty and medical treatment or care measures against a person's will. If a person threatens to seriously harm themself, coercive measures can serve a person's welfare. Nevertheless, every instance of such \"benevolent coercion\" represents a serious infringement of the fundamental rights of the person concerned and is therefore in particular need of legal and ethical justification. Firstly, the Opinion is indented to raise public awareness of the problems and complexities around benevolent coercion. Secondly, it aims to draw the attention of politicians, legislators and practitioners to regulatory and implementation deficits and it formulates recommendations to remedy them. Thirdly, it intends to support the health and social professions in reorienting their self-image and their practice. The Opinion contains general recommendations for the responsible handling of coercion in professional caring relationships, as well as specific advice for psychiatry, child and youth support services, and the fields of elderly and disability care. === Vaccination as a Duty? === Using the example of measles, the council has examined which regulatory measures are ethically and legally acceptable to meet vaccination goals.

The user’s privacy information that comes with giving the app the access to block spam calls may be leaked without the user’s consent or knowledge of it even occurring. In the study, the researchers analyze the challenges and trade-offs related to using local differential privacy, evaluate the LDP-based system on real-world user-reported call records collected by the FTC, and show that it is possible to learn a phone blacklist using a reasonable overall privacy budget and at the same time preserve users’ privacy while maintaining utility for the learned blacklist. === Trajectory Cross-Correlation Constraint === Aiming to solve the problem of low data utilization and privacy protection, a personalized differential privacy protection method based on cross-correlation constraints is proposed by researcher Hu. By protecting sensitive location points on the trajectory and the sensitive points, this extended differential privacy protection model combines the sensitivity of the user’s trajectory location and user privacy protection requirements and privacy budget. Using autocorrelation Laplace transform, specific white noise is transformed into noise that is related to the user's real trajectory sequence in both time and space. This noise data is used to find the cross-correlation constraint mechanics of the trajectory sequence in the model. By proposing this model, the researcher Hu's personalized differential privacy protection method is broken down and addresses the issue of adding independent and uncorrelated noise and the same degree of scrambling results in low privacy protection and poor data availability. == ε-local differential privacy == === Definition of ε-local differential privacy === Let ε be a positive real number and \\mathcal{A} be a randomized algorithm that takes a user's private data\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Algorithms of Oppression\nContent: of women being shamed due to their activity in the porn industry, regardless if it was consensual or not.

Google claims that they safeguard our data in order to protect us from losing our information, but fails to address what happens when you want your data to be deleted. ===Chapter 5=== In Chapter 5 of Algorithms of Oppression, Noble moves the discussion away from google and onto other information sources deemed credible and neutral. Noble says that prominent libraries, including the Library of Congress, encourage whiteness, heteronormativity, patriarchy and other societal standards as correct, and alternatives as problematic. She explains this problem by discussing a case between Dartmouth College and the Library of Congress where \"student-led organization the Coalition for Immigration Reform, Equality (CoFired) and DREAMers\" engaged in a two-year battle to change the Library's terminology from 'illegal aliens' to 'noncitizen' or 'unauthorised immigrants.' Noble later discusses the problems that ensue from misrepresentation and classification which allows her to enforce the importance of contextualisation. Noble argues that it is not just google, but all digital search engines that reinforce societal structures and discriminatory biases and by doing so she points out just how interconnected technology and society are. === Chapter 6 === In Chapter 6 of Algorithms of Oppression, Safiya Noble discusses possible solutions for the problem of algorithmic bias.

Information transmission and literacy are essential concerns in establishing an ethical foundation that promotes fair, equitable, and responsible practices. Information ethics broadly examines issues related to ownership, access, privacy, security, and community. It is also concerned with relational issues such as \"the relationship between information and the good of society, the relationship between information providers and the consumers of information\". Information technology affects common issues such as copyright protection, intellectual freedom, accountability, privacy, and security. Many of these issues are difficult or impossible to resolve due to fundamental tensions between Western moral philosophies (based on rules, democracy, individual rights, and personal freedoms) and the traditional Eastern cultures (based on relationships, hierarchy, collective responsibilities, and social harmony).M.G. Martinsons and D. Ma (2009) \"Sub- Cultural Differences in Information Ethics across China: Focus On Chinese Management Generation Gaps\", Journal of the Association for Information Systems 10.11, 957-973. The multi-faceted dispute between Google and the government of the People's Republic of China reflects some of these fundamental tensions. Professional codes offer a basis for making ethical decisions and applying ethical solutions to situations involving information provision and use which reflect an organization's commitment to responsible information service. Evolving information formats and needs require continual reconsideration of ethical principles and how these codes are applied. Considerations regarding information ethics influence \"personal decisions, professional practice, and public policy\".E. Elrod and M. Smith (2005). \"Information Ethics\", in Encyclopedia of Science, Technology, and Ethics, ed. by Carl Mitcham. Vol. 2: D-K (1004-1011). Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA.

(26 October 2017). \"Artificial Intelligence Beats CAPTCHA\" == Biometric data-based proofs == === The proof of UniqueID === To avoid the problems associated with the recurrent nature of PoP parties and strengthen identification methods against spoofed identities, the use of biometric identification and data storage of individuals/minters were introduced. The first comprehensive study was proposed in June 2018. According to the white paper, individuals are biometrically identified in person by local verifiers. Then their data are encrypted using a trusted setup and recorded in the blockchain. The system relies on the Ethereum blockchain for the execution of a set of smart contracts. The protocol also proposes the use of CAPTCHA parties and the involvement of trusted, famous people to strengthen the system against Sybil attacks. The proof of UniqueID achieves the goal of assigning one minting token to each identified individual while not requiring attendance to multiple recurrent PoP parties; however, there are some challenges and possible criticisms to consider under this proposal: # The reliance on the Ethereum blockchain ultimately ties down the security of the system to the security of the Ethereum blockchain and may present serious technical challenges. # A trusted setup for biometric data encryption may not guarantee the privacy of users against a\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Chris Hoofnagle\nContent: of the GDPR's regulations. ==== The United States==== The U.S.'s Privacy Act of 1974 and Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 (FCRA) are the framework for U.S. privacy law. Hoofnagle argues that these regulations don't adequately protect privacy, as many companies have found loopholes to them. He argues that the problem with the Privacy Act is that it only applies to the federal government and private companies that work for the government. It does not apply to other private companies or data brokers. Hoofnagle additionally criticizes the FCRA for solely applying to \"consumer reporting agencies\" that use \"consumer reports.\" Consumer reports solely concern communication on a consumer relating to credit evaluation, employment screening, insurance underwriting, or licensing, and all other uses are not protected by the FCRA. Hoofnagle and Daniel Solove propose a series of regulations that they label as \"The Model Regime\" as solutions to the problems they propose with U.S. privacy law. These solutions include: # Universal notice of when companies collect individuals’ private information # Meaningful consent of consumers when data is collected # Meaningful exercise of consumers’ rights, # Effective individual management of consumer reporting # Accessing personal information that companies store # Greater security of information # Disclosing security breaches # Limiting use of social security numbers # Regulating access to public records # Limiting use of background checks # Regulating private investigators # Limiting government access to business and financial records # Regulating government data mining # Updating the Privacy Act # Effectively enforcing privacy rights ==== Europe and U.S. compared==== One key divergence between the United States and Europe with regard to privacy is how privacy is discussed legally.

Eshoo proposed a new bill, the Invest in Child Safety Act, in May 2020 that would give to the Department of Justice to give additional manpower and tools to enable them to address child exploitation directly rather than to rely on technology companies to rein in the problem. == Technical implications == While the language of the proposed bill does not directly mention encryption, security experts anticipate that it will be addressed in committee recommendations should the bill pass. These recommendations may include requiring any online service that provides end-to- end encryption to begin including backdoors that would allow government or law enforcement to read private communications. Many companies with strong security use end-to-end encryption on data transmitted between the company and the consumer. This encryption also means, by definition, that no-one, including governments, is able to scan this data for child sexual abuse material and other prohibited content before it reaches its destination. Some experts worry that companies may eliminate encryption on their online platforms because they fear civil and criminal liability if they are unable to prevent such content from being posted on their platforms. These experts argue that the proposed bill could discourage the use of encryption, resulting in less secure personal data that may be more easily accessible to hackers. Other experts have gone a step further, arguing that any barriers to the use of encryption will result in a more dangerous and less free internet. ==References== Category:Proposed legislation of the 116th United States Congress Category:Proposed legislation\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Business ethics\nContent: Salomon Brothers. Not everyone supports corporate policies that govern ethical conduct. Some claim that ethical problems are better dealt with by depending upon employees to use their own judgment. Others believe that corporate ethics policies are primarily rooted in utilitarian concerns and that they are mainly to limit the company's legal liability or to curry public favor by giving the appearance of being a good corporate citizen. Ideally, the company will avoid a lawsuit because its employees will follow the rules. Should a lawsuit occur, the company can claim that the problem would not have arisen if the employee had only followed the code properly. Some corporations have tried to burnish their ethical image by creating whistle-blower protections, such as anonymity. In the case of Citi, they call this the Ethics Hotline. Though it is unclear whether firms such as Citi take offences reported to these hotlines seriously or not. Sometimes there is a disconnection between the company's code of ethics and the company's actual practices. Thus, whether or not such conduct is explicitly sanctioned by management, at worst, this makes the policy duplicitous, and, at best, it is merely a marketing tool. Jones and Parker wrote, \"Most of what we read under the name business ethics is either sentimental common sense or a set of excuses for being unpleasant.\" Many manuals are procedural form filling exercises unconcerned about the real ethical dilemmas. For instance, the US Department of Commerce ethics program treats business ethics as a set of instructions and procedures to be followed by 'ethics officers'., some others claim being ethical is just for the sake of being ethical. Business ethicists may trivialize the subject, offering standard answers that do not reflect the situation's complexity.

Furthermore, there are numerous other verbs that can be viewed as modal verbs insofar as they clearly express modality in the same way that the verbs in this list do, e.g. appear, have to, seem etc. In the strict sense, though, these other verbs do not qualify as modal verbs in English because they do not allow subject- auxiliary inversion, nor do they allow negation with not. Verbs such as be able to and be about to allow subject-auxiliary inversion and do not require do-support in negatives but these are rarely classified as modal verbs because they inflect and are a modal construction involving the verb to be which itself is not a modal verb. If, however, one defines modal verb entirely in terms of meaning contribution, then these other verbs would also be modals and so the list here would have to be greatly expanded. === Defectiveness === In English, modals form a very distinctive class of verbs.

Modern usage may carry the connotation of mild intensity. : field paddy vast '(very) expansive fields and paddies' '(very) expansive fields and paddies' '(very) expansive fields and paddies' '(very) expansive fields and paddies' ====Verb phrase==== Khmer verbs are completely uninflected, and once a subject or topic has been introduced or is clear from context the noun phrase may be dropped. Thus, the simplest possible sentence in Khmer consists of a single verb. For example, 'to go' on its own can mean \"I'm going.\", \"He went.\", \"They've gone.\", \"Let's go.\", etc. This also results in long strings of verbs such as: : I to want to go to walk to play 'I want to go for a stroll.'

It indicates movement toward that argument. There are two sets of allative prefixes. Of the two allative paradigms the first set can turn verbs from intransitive to transitive, from transitive to ditransitive. The second set is only found on three verbs: lap ‘search’, lɔfɛ ‘call’ and tain ‘release’. An example from each set of prefixes: Set 1: Set 2: ==== Ablative prefixes ==== Ablative prefixes also increase the valency of a verb to indicate movement away from its referent. This movement may be physical or metaphorical. The collection of verbs that can have an ablative prefix is very limited and consists of five verbs: papaɲ ‘imitate’, mala ‘shy’, baroc ‘afraid’, tafuniŋ ‘hide’ and tɛʔɛŋ ‘run’. === Valency-increasing prefixes === ==== Applicative prefix ==== Applicative prefix u- increases a verb’s valency by introducing a theme to a sentence. Other possible roles of an added argument are goals or beneficiaries. If it occurs together with a pronominal prefix, the applicative suffix precedes the pronominal suffix. Example: ==== Causative prefix ==== The causative prefix adds a ‘causer’ to a proposition, thereby increasing a verb’s valency. There are only ten intransitive verbs that may carry a causative prefix. These include muj ‘fall down’, mih ‘sit’ and tɔh ‘stand’. The prefix almost always occurs together with a pronominal prefix, which precedes it. The only exception is ʔɔl ‘fall over’. An example: === Serial verb constructions === Serial verb constructions are very common in Adang. Serial verb constructions consist of multiple verbs combined into a single predicate, and share arguments and features such as aspect and negation.

The Icelandic Ministry of Education considers both variants to be equally correct. ==Origin== Historically, róa and snúa belonged to the seventh class of \"strong\" (irregular) verbs, which was the only class of verbs in Germanic that had retained the reduplication inherited from the Proto-Indo-European perfect aspect. In Old Norse, the verb sá (\"to sow\") also belonged to this group, but it has become regular in Modern Icelandic. The past tense of these three verbs from Proto-Germanic and Proto-North-Germanic was as follows: * *rōaną (\"to row\") - *rerō (\"I rowed\")\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Generate three verbs that mean the same as 'to apologize'\n\n[/INST]IDs: </s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

Originally the kits worked by people taking a hair sample, and posting into the laboratory for testing. The kit was first reported in the Australian newspaper The Herald in 1998. These home testing kits have since revolutionized DNA testing, and the industry has subsequently adopted DNA Solutions' terminology of using \"home kit\" and \"home paternity kit\" a term now used by virtually all DNA testing companies and laboratories for the \"use at home\" DNA testing services. This new type of DNA testing led to a great deal of controversy, especially in the year 2000, when the Vice President of the Australian Medical Association issued a press releasing calling for a ban of DNA Solutions's services due to issues of privacy and consent.Australian newspaper, The Age, report on call for ban of the new DNA tests, year 2000 News of the new tests, and their availability online spread worldwidehttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/901401.stm BBC news report on the new tests, year 2000http://wwwc.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/0010/02/pappa.html Sweden's national newspaper Aftonbladet reports on DNA Solutions new tests.

It is a method to mark items in a way that is undetectable to the naked eye. A unique DNA marker is applied to the item, and can be recovered to identify the item. In suspected thefts, the suspect can also be tested for traces of the DNA marking. DNA marking can be used to prevent thefts of objects that are hard to mark in any other way (e.g. copper cables). It can also be used to help separate between genuine and counterfeit electronics and other replacement parts. ==References== Category:DNA Category:Crime prevention\n\nID: 5\nTitle: DNA\nContent: text: thumb|Simplified diagram Deoxyribonucleic acid (; DNA) is a polymer composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix. The polymer carries genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses. DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are nucleic acids. Alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), nucleic acids are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. The two DNA strands are known as polynucleotides as they are composed of simpler monomeric units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases (cytosine [C], guanine [G], adenine [A] or thymine [T]), a sugar called deoxyribose, and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds (known as the phosphodiester linkage) between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups, pyrimidines and purines. In DNA, the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine; the purines are adenine and guanine. Both strands of double-stranded DNA store the same biological information. This information is replicated when the two strands separate. A large part of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is non-coding, meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences. The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are thus antiparallel.\n\nID: 6\nTitle: DNA database\nContent: text: A DNA database or DNA databank is a database of DNA profiles which can be used in the analysis of genetic diseases, genetic fingerprinting for criminology, or genetic genealogy. DNA databases may be public or private, the largest ones being national DNA databases. DNA databases are often employed in forensic investigations. When a match is made from a national DNA database to link a crime scene to a person whose DNA profile is stored on a database, that link is often referred to as a cold hit. A cold hit is of particular value in linking a specific person to a crime scene, but is of less evidential value than a DNA match made without the use of a DNA database.Rose & Goos: DNA - A Practical Guide (Carswell Publications, Toronto). Research shows that DNA databases of criminal offenders reduce crime rates. ==Types== ===Forensic=== A forensic database is a centralized DNA database for storing DNA profiles of individuals that enables searching and comparing of DNA samples collected from a crime scene against stored profiles. The most important function of the forensic database is to produce matches between the suspected individual and crime scene bio-markers, and then provides evidence to support criminal investigations, and also leads to identify potential suspects in the criminal investigation. Majority of the National DNA databases are used for forensic purposes. The Interpol DNA database is used in criminal investigations. Interpol maintains an automated DNA database called DNA Gateway that contains DNA profiles submitted by member countries collected from crime scenes, missing persons, and unidentified bodies. The DNA Gateway was established in 2002, and at the end of 2013, it had more than 140,000 DNA profiles from 69 member countries. Unlike other DNA databases, DNA Gateway is only used for information sharing\n\nID: 7\nTitle: National DNA Data Bank of Canada\nContent: DNA Program Category:Biometrics Category:DNA Category:Law enforcement in Canada Category:National DNA databases Category:Forensic databases Category:Biological databases\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: What does DNA stand for?\n\n[/INST]IDs: 5</s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

The United States maintained its Cold War engagement with the Soviet Union during the period, despite internal preoccupations with the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the Civil Rights Movement and the opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War. In 1968, Eastern Bloc member Czechoslovakia attempted the reforms of the Prague Spring and was subsequently invaded by the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact members, who reinstated the Soviet model. By 1973, the US had withdrawn from the Vietnam War. While communists gained power in some South East Asian countries, they were divided by the Sino-Soviet Split, with China moving closer to the Western camp, following US President Richard Nixon's visit to China. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Third World was increasingly divided between governments backed by the Soviets (such as Libya, Iraq, Syria, Egypt and South Yemen), governments backed by NATO (such as Saudi Arabia), and a growing camp of non-aligned nations. The Soviet and other Eastern Bloc economies began to stagnate. Worldwide inflation occurred following the 1973 oil crisis. ==Third World and non-alignment in the 1960s and 1970s== ===Decolonization=== Cold War politics were affected by decolonization in Africa, Asia, and to a limited extent, Latin America as well.

Despite this recovery, the Cold War developed from its modest beginnings in the late 1940s to a heated competition between the Soviet Union and the United States by the early 1960s. The ideological clash between communism and capitalism dominated the decade, especially in the Northern Hemisphere In the United States, a wave of anti- communist sentiment known as the Second Red Scare aka McCarthyism resulted in Congressional hearings by both houses in Congress. In the Soviet Union, the death of Joseph Stalin would lead to a political campaign and reforms known as \"De-Stalinization\" initiated by Nikita Khrushchev leading to the deterioration between the relationship of the USSR and the People's Republic of China in the 60s. The beginning of the Cold War lead to beginning of the Space Race with the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957 and the United States would create NASA in response in 1958. Along with increased testing of nuclear weapons (such as RDS-37 and Upshot–Knothole) called the arms race, the tense geopolitical situation created a politically conservative climate. The beginning of decolonization in Africa and Asia also took place in this decade and accelerated in the following decade albeit would lead to several conflicts throughout the decade and so on. Wars include the First Indochina War, Malayan Emergency, Korean War, the Algerian War, the First Sudanese Civil War, the Vietnam War, the Cuban Revolution, and the Suez Crisis. Coups include the Egyptian revolution, the Iranian coup d'état, the Guatemalan coup d'état, the 14 July Revolution in Iraq, and the Pakistani coup d'état in 1958.

Alternatively, it can be done by identifying a single defining collocate for each class, and using for seeds only those contexts containing one of these defining words. A publicly available database WordNet can be used as an automatic source for such defining terms. In addition, words that occur near the target word in great frequency can be selected as seed collocations representative. This approach is not fully automatic, a human judge must decide which word will be selected for each target word’s sense, the outputs will be reliable indicators of the senses. A decision list algorithm is then used to identify other reliable collocations. This training algorithm calculates the probability Pr(Sense | Collocation), and the decision list is ranked by the log-likelihood ratio: : \\log \\left( \\frac{\\Pr(\\text{Sense}_A \\mid \\text{Collocation}_i)}{ \\Pr( \\text{Sense}_B \\mid \\text{Collocation}_i)} \\right) A smoothing algorithm will then be used to avoid 0 values. The decision-list algorithm resolves many problems in a large set of non- independent evidence source by using only the most reliable piece of evidence rather than the whole matching collocation set. The new resulting classifier will then be applied to the whole sample set. Add those examples in the residual that are tagged as A or B with probability above a reasonable threshold to the seed sets. The decision-list algorithm and the above adding step are applied iteratively. As more newly-learned collocations are added to the seed sets, the sense A or\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Superimposed code\nContent: list of R subjects goes something like this: * For the first subject, pick n of the N slots randomly. * For the second subject, pick n of the N slots randomly—but make sure this pattern is not identical to the first subject. * ... * For the R'th subject, pick n of the N slots randomly—but make sure it's not identical to any previous subject. === Other superimposed codes === A Zatocode requires a code book that lists every subject and a randomly generated notch code associated with each one. Other \"direct\" superimposed codes have a fixed hash function for transforming the letters in (one spelling of) a subject into a notch code. Such codes require a much shorter code book that describes the translation of letters in a word to the corresponding notch code, and can in principle easily add new subjects without changing the code book. A Bloom filter can be considered a kind of superimposed code.

The number of possible sequences of words increases exponentially with the size of the vocabulary, causing a data sparsity problem because of the exponentially many sequences. Thus, statistics are needed to properly estimate probabilities. Neural networks avoid this problem by representing words in a distributed way, as non-linear combinations of weights in a neural net. An alternate description is that a neural net approximates the language function. The neural net architecture might be feed-forward or recurrent, and while the former is simpler the latter is more common. Typically, neural net language models are constructed and trained as probabilistic classifiers that learn to predict a probability distribution P(w_t \\mid \\mathrm{context}) \\, \\forall t \\in V. That is, the network is trained to predict a probability distribution over the vocabulary, given some linguistic context. This is done using standard neural net training algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation. The context might be a fixed-size window of previous words, so that the network predicts P(w_t \\mid w_{t-k}, \\dots, w_{t-1}) from a feature vector representing the previous words. Another option is to use \"future\" words as well as \"past\" words as features, so that the estimated probability is P(w_t \\mid w_{t-k}, \\dots, w_{t-1}, w_{t+1}, \\dots, w_{t+k}). This is called a bag-of-words model. When the feature vectors for the words in the context are combined by a continuous operation, this model is referred to as the continuous bag-of-words architecture (CBOW). A third option that trains slower than the CBOW but performs slightly better is to invert the previous problem and make a neural network learn the context, given a word.

The dictionary can be accessed using the `dict:find/2` function: {ok, Phone} = dict:find(\"Sally Smith\", PhoneBook), io:format(\"Phone: ~s~n\", [Phone]). In both cases, any Erlang term can be used as the key. Variations include the `orddict` module, implementing ordered dictionaries, and `gb_trees`, implementing general balanced trees. ====Maps==== Maps were introduced in OTP 17.0, and combine the strengths of keylists and dictionaries. A map is defined using the syntax `#{ K1 => V1, ... Kn => Vn }`: PhoneBook = #{\"Sally Smith\" => \"555-9999\", \"John Doe\" => \"555-1212\", \"J. Random Hacker\" => \"553-1337\"}. Basic functions to interact with maps are available from the `maps` module. For example, the `maps:find/2` function returns the value associated with a key: {ok, Phone} = maps:find(\"Sally Smith\", PhoneBook), io:format(\"Phone: ~s~n\", [Phone]). Unlike dictionaries, maps can be pattern matched upon: #{\"Sally Smith\", Phone} = PhoneBook, io:format(\"Phone: ~s~n\", [Phone]). Erlang also provides syntax sugar for functional updates—creating a new map based on an existing one, but with modified values or additional keys: PhoneBook2 = PhoneBook#{ % the `:=` operator updates the value associated with an existing key \"J.

It is also known as detent or no-current torque. This torque is position dependent and its periodicity per revolution depends on the number of magnetic poles and the number of teeth on the stator. Cogging torque is an undesirable component for the operation of such a motor. It is especially prominent at lower speeds, with the symptom of jerkiness. Cogging torque results in torque as well as speed ripple; however, at high speed the motor moment of inertia filters out the effect of cogging torque. ==Reducing the cogging torque== A summary of techniques used for reducing cogging torque: * Skewing stator stack or magnets * Using fractional slots per pole * Optimizing the magnet pole arc or width Almost all the techniques used against cogging torque also reduce the motor counter-electromotive force and so reduce the resultant running torque. A slotless and coreless permanent magnet motor does not have any cogging torque. ==See also== * Torque ripple * Dual-rotor permanent magnet induction motor ==Footnotes and References== *Islam, M.S.

The measurement of the induced voltage provides a simple method to diagnose the electromagnetic behavior of the motor. Regularities are derived from a moving conductor loop in a constant magnetic field. ====Measuring the cogging torque==== In rotating electrical machines, the number of poles in the rotor multiplied by the number of strands in the stator equals the number of preferred stable positions in which the rotor moves. The amount of cogging torque is significantly influenced by the structural design. Regardless of the type of measurement, the load machine drives the currentless test object. The cogging torque is measured with a torque transducer connected between the test object and the load machine. The cogging torque can be determined in two different ways: Measurement of the cogging torque at slow speed or measurement of the cogging torque with closed-loop position control. For both measurements, an active load machine is required to drive the test object. == See also == * Test bay == References == == Literature == * Prof. Dr.-Ing Klaus Metzger (Hrsg):Prüfung von Elektromotoren, imc Meßsysteme GmbH, 2010, Category:Electric motors Category:Quality assurance Category:Tests\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Direct-drive mechanism\nContent: and being a simpler design with fewer moving parts. Major benefits also include the ability to deliver high torque over a wide range of speeds, fast response, precise positioning, and low inertia.Uday Shanker Dixit, Manjuri Hazarika, J. Paulo Davim (2016) A Brief History of Mechanical Engineering, ch.7 \"History of Mechatronics\", pp.160-161K. T. Chau Electric Vehicle Machines and Drives: Design, Analysis and Application, ch.8 \"Vernier Permanent Magnet Motor Drives\", p.227 The main drawback is that a special type of electric motor is often needed to provide high torque outputs at low rpm. Compared with a multi-speed transmission, the motor is usually operating in its optimal power band for a smaller range of output speeds for the system (e.g., road speeds in the case of a motor vehicle). Direct-drive mechanisms also need a more precise control mechanism. High-speed motors with speed reduction have relatively high inertia, which helps smooth the output motion. Most motors exhibit positional torque ripple known as cogging torque. In high-speed motors, this effect is usually negligible, as the frequency at which it occurs is too high to significantly affect system performance; direct-drive units will suffer more from this phenomenon unless additional inertia is added (i.e. by a flywheel) or the system uses feedback to actively counter the effect. ==Applications== Direct- drive mechanisms are used in applications ranging from low speed operation (such as phonographs, telescope mounts and ski lifts, video game racing wheels and gearless wind turbines) to high speeds (such as fans, computer hard drives, VCR heads, sewing machines, CNC machines and washing machines.) Some electric railway locomotives have used direct-drive mechanisms, such as the 1919 Milwaukee Road class EP-2 and the 2007 East Japan Railway Company E331.

It is the ratio of torque capability to volume and is expressed in units of torque per volume. Torque density is a system property since it depends on the design of each element of the component being examined and their interconnection. Torque density is useful during the concept evaluation stage of mechanical designs, especially in power train design problems. Typically, it will be one of many factors used to assign potential success measures to each concept. For example, in the upgrade of a drive train for a set of rolls in a rolling mill, space is often dictated by the configuration of current components. There may be several types of devices that can perform the function of an existing component that must be replaced. The relative torque densities of the devices may be an important determinant for which design is ultimately selected, although it will often compete with other factors such as cost, ease of maintenance, time to install, operating costs and potential failure modes. ==Units== In SI units, torque density is expressed in joules per cubic metre or equivalently newton-metres per cubic metre (though dimensionally equivalent to the pascal, that is usually not used for this purpose). Small amounts can be expressed in newton-millimetres per cubic millimetre. In U.S. customary units, torque density is expressed in foot-pounds force per cubic foot, or inch-pounds force per cubic inch or ounce-force inches per cubic inch.

It is measured as the difference in maximum and minimum torque over one complete revolution, generally expressed as a percentage. ==Examples== A common example is \"cogging torque\" due to slight asymmetries in the magnetic field generated by the motor windings, which causes variations in the reluctance depending on the rotor position. This effect can be reduced by careful selection of the winding layout of the motor, or through the use of realtime controls to the power delivery. ==References== *\"Torque ripple\", Emetor Category:Electric motors Category:Torsional vibration\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Inerter (mechanical networks)\nContent: text: thumb|Inerter device being used to mechanically isolate vibration at a given frequency. In the study of mechanical networks in control theory, an inerter is a two-terminal device in which the forces applied at the terminals are equal, opposite, and proportional to relative acceleration between the nodes. Under the name of J-damper the concept has been used in Formula 1 racing car suspension systems. It can be constructed with a flywheel mounted on a rack and pinion. It has a similar effect to increasing the inertia of the sprung object. ==Discovery== Malcolm C. Smith, a control engineering professor at the University of Cambridge, first introduced inerters in a 2002 paper. Smith extended the analogy between electrical and mechanical networks (the mobility analogy). He observed that the analogy was incomplete, since it was missing a mechanical device playing the same role as an electrical capacitor. The analogy makes mass the analogy of capacitance, but the capacitor representing a mass always has one terminal connected to ground potential. In a real electrical network, capacitors can be connected between any two arbitrary potentials, they are not limited to ground. Noticing this, Smith set about finding a mechanical device that was a true analog of a capacitor. He found that he could construct such a device using gears and flywheels, one of several possible methods. The constitutive equation is, : F=b(\\dot{v}_2-\\dot{v}_1), where the constant b is the inertance and has units of mass. ==Construction== A linear inerter can be constructed by meshing a flywheel with a rack gear. The pivot of the flywheel forms one terminal of the device, and the rack gear forms the other. A rotational inerter can be constructed by meshing a flywheel with the ring gear\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Electromagnetically induced acoustic noise\nContent: radiation and large vibration levels). Vibration level is increased in case of a mechanical resonance, when electromagnetic forces match with a structural mode natural frequency of the active component (magnetic circuit, electromagnetic coil or electrical circuit) or of its enclosure. The frequency of the noise depends on the nature of electromagnetic forces (quadratic or linear function of electrical field or magnetic field) and on the frequency content of the electromagnetic field (in particular if a DC component is present or not). == Electromagnetic noise and vibrations in electric machines == Electromagnetic torque, which can be calculated as the average value of the Maxwell stress tensor along the airgap, is one consequence of electromagnetic forces in electric machines. As a static force, it does not create vibrations nor acoustic noise. However torque ripple (also called cogging torque for permanent magnet synchronous machines in open circuit), which represents the harmonic variations of electromagnetic torque, is a dynamic force creating torsional vibrations of both rotor and stator. The torsional deflection of a simple cylinder cannot radiate efficiently acoustic noise, but with particular boundary conditions the stator can radiate acoustic noise under torque ripple excitation.Tan Kim A.

By the late 1800s, Franz Reuleaux had identified hundreds of machine elements, calling them simple machines. Modern machine theory analyzes machines as kinematic chains composed of elementary linkages called kinematic pairs. ==History== The idea of a simple machine originated with the Greek philosopher Archimedes around the 3rd century BC, who studied the Archimedean simple machines: lever, pulley, and screw. He discovered the principle of mechanical advantage in the lever. Archimedes' famous remark with regard to the lever: \"Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth,\" ()Quoted by Pappus of Alexandria in Synagoge, Book VIII expresses his realization that there was no limit to the amount of force amplification that could be achieved by using mechanical advantage. Later Greek philosophers defined the classic five simple machines (excluding the inclined plane) and were able to calculate their (ideal) mechanical advantage. For example, Heron of Alexandria (c. 10–75 AD) in his work Mechanics lists five mechanisms that can \"set a load in motion\": lever, windlass, pulley, wedge, and screw, and describes their fabrication and uses. However the Greeks' understanding was limited to the statics of simple machines (the balance of forces), and did not include dynamics, the tradeoff between force and distance, or the concept of work. During the Renaissance the dynamics of the mechanical powers, as the simple machines were called, began to be studied from the standpoint of how far they could lift a load, in addition to the force they could apply, leading eventually to the new concept of mechanical work.

The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid and the liquid evaporates resulting in an abrupt change in vapor volume. In a closed system, saturation temperature and boiling point mean the same thing. The saturation temperature is the temperature for a corresponding saturation pressure at which a liquid boils into its vapor phase. The liquid can be said to be saturated with thermal energy. Any addition of thermal energy results in a phase transition. At standard atmospheric pressure and low temperatures, no boiling occurs and the heat transfer rate is controlled by the usual single-phase mechanisms. As the surface temperature is increased, local boiling occurs and vapor bubbles nucleate, grow into the surrounding cooler fluid, and collapse. This is sub- cooled nucleate boiling, and is a very efficient heat transfer mechanism. At high bubble generation rates, the bubbles begin to interfere and the heat flux no longer increases rapidly with surface temperature (this is the departure from nucleate boiling, or DNB). At similar standard atmospheric pressure and high temperatures, the hydrodynamically quieter regime of film boiling is reached. Heat fluxes across the stable vapor layers are low, but rise slowly with temperature. Any contact between fluid and the surface that may be seen probably leads to the extremely rapid nucleation of a fresh vapor layer (\"spontaneous nucleation\"). At higher temperatures still, a maximum in the heat flux is reached (the critical heat flux, or CHF). The Leidenfrost Effect demonstrates how nucleate boiling slows heat transfer due to gas bubbles on the heater's surface. As mentioned, gas-phase thermal conductivity is much lower than liquid-phase thermal conductivity, so the outcome is a kind of \"gas thermal\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Boiling-point elevation\nContent: text: Boiling-point elevation describes the phenomenon that the boiling point of a liquid (a solvent) will be higher when another compound is added, meaning that a solution has a higher boiling point than a pure solvent. This happens whenever a non-volatile solute, such as a salt, is added to a pure solvent, such as water. The boiling point can be measured accurately using an ebullioscope. ==Explanation== thumb|400px|The change in chemical potential of a solvent when a solute is added explains why boiling point elevation takes place. The boiling point elevation is a colligative property, which means that it is dependent on the presence of dissolved particles and their number, but not their identity. It is an effect of the dilution of the solvent in the presence of a solute. It is a phenomenon that happens for all solutes in all solutions, even in ideal solutions, and does not depend on any specific solute–solvent interactions. The boiling point elevation happens both when the solute is an electrolyte, such as various salts, and a nonelectrolyte. In thermodynamic terms, the origin of the boiling point elevation is entropic and can be explained in terms of the vapor pressure or chemical potential of the solvent. In both cases, the explanation depends on the fact that many solutes are only present in the liquid phase and do not enter into the gas phase (except at extremely high temperatures). Put in vapor pressure terms, a liquid boils at the temperature when its vapor pressure equals the surrounding pressure. For the solvent, the presence of the solute decreases its vapor pressure by dilution. A nonvolatile solute has a vapor pressure of zero, so the vapor pressure of the solution is less than the vapor pressure of the\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Boiling\nContent: bringing it to its boiling point is also a useful indication that can be seen without the help of a thermometer, and by this time, the water is disinfected. Though the boiling point decreases with increasing altitude, it is not enough to affect the disinfecting process. ===In cooking=== Boiling is the method of cooking food in boiling water or other water-based liquids such as stock or milk. Simmering is gentle boiling, while in poaching the cooking liquid moves but scarcely bubbles. The boiling point of water is typically considered to be , especially at sea level. Pressure and a change in the composition of the liquid may alter the boiling point of the liquid. High elevation cooking generally takes longer since boiling point is a function of atmospheric pressure. At an elevation of about , water boils at approximately . Depending on the type of food and the elevation, the boiling water may not be hot enough to cook the food properly. Similarly, increasing the pressure as in a pressure cooker raises the temperature of the contents above the open air boiling point. ===Boil-in-the-bag=== Also known as \"boil-in-bag\", this involves heating or cooking ready-made foods sealed in a thick plastic bag. The bag containing the food, often frozen, is submerged in boiling water for a prescribed time. The resulting dishes can be prepared with greater convenience as no pots or pans are dirtied in the process. Such meals are available for camping as well as home dining. ==Contrast with evaporation== At any given temperature, the molecules in a liquid have varying kinetic energies.

The boiling point of a liquid varies depending upon the surrounding environmental pressure. A liquid in a partial vacuum, i.e., under a lower pressure, has a lower boiling point than when that liquid is at atmospheric pressure. Because of this, water boils at under standard pressure at sea level, but at at altitude. For a given pressure, different liquids will boil at different temperatures. The normal boiling point (also called the atmospheric boiling point or the atmospheric pressure boiling point) of a liquid is the special case in which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the defined atmospheric pressure at sea level, one atmosphere.General Chemistry Glossary Purdue University website page At that temperature, the vapor pressure of the liquid becomes sufficient to overcome atmospheric pressure and allow bubbles of vapor to form inside the bulk of the liquid. The standard boiling point has been defined by IUPAC since 1982 as the temperature at which boiling occurs under a pressure of one bar. The heat of vaporization is the energy required to transform a given quantity (a mol, kg, pound, etc.) of a substance from a liquid into a gas at a given pressure (often atmospheric pressure). Liquids may change to a vapor at temperatures below their boiling points through the process of evaporation. Evaporation is a surface phenomenon in which molecules located near the liquid's edge, not contained by enough liquid pressure on that side, escape into the surroundings as vapor. On the other hand, boiling is a process in which molecules anywhere in the liquid escape, resulting in the formation of vapor\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Boiling point\nContent: boiling point can be calculated by using the Clausius–Clapeyron equation, thus: :T_\\text{B} = \\left(\\frac{1}{T_0} - \\frac{R\\,\\ln \\frac{P}{P_0}}{\\Delta H_\\text{vap}}\\right)^{-1} where: :T_\\text{B} is the boiling point at the pressure of interest, :R is the ideal gas constant, :P is the vapor pressure of the liquid, :P_0 is some pressure where the corresponding T_0 is known (usually data available at 1 atm or 100 kPa), :\\Delta H_\\text{vap} is the heat of vaporization of the liquid, :T_0 is the boiling temperature, :\\ln is the natural logarithm. Saturation pressure is the pressure for a corresponding saturation temperature at which a liquid boils into its vapor phase. Saturation pressure and saturation temperature have a direct relationship: as saturation pressure is increased, so is saturation temperature. If the temperature in a system remains constant (an isothermal system), vapor at saturation pressure and temperature will begin to condense into its liquid phase as the system pressure is increased. Similarly, a liquid at saturation pressure and temperature will tend to flash into its vapor phase as system pressure is decreased. There are two conventions regarding the standard boiling point of water: The normal boiling point is at a pressure of 1 atm (i.e., 101.325 kPa).

The Clausius-Clapeyron relation also applies to the boiling point, but with the liquid/gas transition the vapor phase has a much lower density than the liquid phase, so the boiling point increases with pressure. Water can remain in a liquid state at high temperatures in the deep ocean or underground. For example, temperatures exceed in Old Faithful, a geyser in Yellowstone National Park. In hydrothermal vents, the temperature can exceed . At sea level, the boiling point of water is . As atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude, the boiling point decreases by 1 °C every 274 meters. High-altitude cooking takes longer than sea-level cooking. For example, at , cooking time must be increased by a fourth to achieve the desired result. (Conversely, a pressure cooker can be used to decrease cooking times by raising the boiling temperature.) In a vacuum, water will boil at room temperature. ==== Triple and critical points ==== thumb|Phase diagram of water (simplified) On a pressure/temperature phase diagram (see figure), there are curves separating solid from vapor, vapor from liquid, and liquid from solid. These meet at a single point called the triple point, where all three phases can coexist.

The water/vapor phase curve terminates at and . This is known as the critical point.

The vapor pressure chart to the right has graphs of the vapor pressures versus temperatures for a variety of liquids. As can be seen in the chart, the liquids with the highest vapor pressures have the lowest normal boiling points. For example, at any given temperature, methyl chloride has the highest vapor pressure of any of the liquids in the chart. It also has the lowest normal boiling point (−24.2 °C), which is where the vapor pressure curve of methyl chloride (the blue line) intersects the horizontal pressure line of one atmosphere (atm) of absolute vapor pressure. The critical point of a liquid is the highest temperature (and pressure) it will actually boil at.

Both the boiling points of rhenium and tungsten exceed 5000 K at standard pressure; because it is difficult to measure extreme temperatures precisely without bias, both have been cited in the literature as having the higher boiling point. ==Boiling point as a reference property of a pure compound== As can be seen from the above\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Boiling\nContent: then allowing it to boil.

In places having a proper water purification system, it is recommended only as an emergency treatment method or for obtaining potable water in the wilderness or in rural areas, as it cannot remove chemical toxins or impurities. The elimination of micro-organisms by boiling follows first-order kinetics—at high temperatures, it is achieved in less time and at lower temperatures, in more time. The heat sensitivity of micro-organisms varies, at , Giardia species (causes Giardiasis) can take ten minutes for complete inactivation, most intestine affecting microbes and E. coli (gastroenteritis) take less than a minute; at boiling point, Vibrio cholerae (cholera) takes ten seconds and hepatitis A virus (causes the symptom of jaundice), one minute. Boiling does not ensure the elimination of all micro-organisms; the bacterial spores Clostridium can survive at but are not water-borne or intestine affecting. Thus for human health, complete sterilization of water is not required. The traditional advice of boiling water for ten minutes is mainly for additional safety, since microbes start getting eliminated at temperatures greater than and bringing it to its boiling point is also a useful\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Look up the boiling point of water.\n\n[/INST]IDs: 3, 4</s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

Charles II was the eldest surviving child of Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland and Henrietta Maria of France. After Charles I's execution at Whitehall on 30 January 1649, at the climax of the English Civil War, the Parliament of Scotland proclaimed Charles II king on 5 February 1649. However, England entered the period known as the English Interregnum or the English Commonwealth, with a government led by Oliver Cromwell. Cromwell defeated Charles II at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651, and Charles fled to mainland Europe. Cromwell became Lord Protector of England, Scotland and Ireland. Charles spent the next nine years in exile in France, the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Netherlands. The political crisis that followed Cromwell's death in 1658 resulted in the restoration of the monarchy, and Charles was invited to return to Britain. On 29 May 1660, his 30th birthday, he was received in London to public acclaim. After 1660, all legal documents stating a regnal year did so as if he had succeeded his father as king in 1649. Charles's English parliament enacted laws known as the Clarendon Code, designed to shore up the position of the re- established Church of England. Charles acquiesced to the Clarendon Code even though he favoured a policy of religious tolerance. The major foreign policy issue of his early reign was the Second Anglo-Dutch War. In 1670, he entered into the Treaty of Dover, an alliance with his cousin King Louis XIV of France. Louis agreed to aid him in the Third Anglo-Dutch War and\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Charles II of Spain\nContent: text: Charles II (, 6 November 1661 – 1 November 1700), known as the Bewitched (), was the last Habsburg ruler of the Spanish Empire. Best remembered for his physical disabilities and the War of the Spanish Succession that followed his death, Charles' reign has traditionally been viewed as one of managed decline. However, many of the issues Spain faced in this period were inherited from his predecessors and some recent historians have suggested a more balanced perspective. For reasons that are still debated, Charles experienced extended periods of ill health throughout his life and from the moment he became king at the age of three in 1665, the succession was a prominent consideration in European politics. Historian John Langdon-Davies summarised his life as follows: \"Of no man is it more true to say that in his beginning was his end; from the day of his birth, they were waiting for his death\". Despite this, his successors inherited an empire that remained largely intact, while under his administration Spain played a prominent role in opposing the expansionist policies of Louis XIV of France. Although Charles married twice, neither union produced children, and on his death in November 1700, he was succeeded by the 16-year-old Philip of Anjou, grandson of his elder half-sister Maria Theresa and Louis XIV. However, the question of who inherited the crown was less important than the division of his territories, and failure to resolve the issue through diplomacy led to war in 1701. ==Personal details== Born on 6 November 1661, Charles was the only surviving son of Philip IV of Spain and Mariana of Austria, who were uncle and niece. While European nobility commonly married within the same extended family to retain property, the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs were unusual in the\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Charles II of England\nContent: many virtues and many great imperfections, debonair, easy of access, not bloody or cruel\". John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, wrote more lewdly of Charles: Looking back on Charles's reign, Tories tended to view it as a time of benevolent monarchy whereas Whigs perceived it as a terrible despotism. Professor Ronald Hutton summarises a polarised historiography: Hutton says Charles was a popular king in his own day and a \"legendary figure\" in British history. The anniversary of the Restoration (which was also Charles's birthday)—29 May—was recognised in England until the mid-nineteenth century as Oak Apple Day, after the Royal Oak in which Charles hid during his escape from the forces of Oliver Cromwell. Traditional celebrations involved the wearing of oak leaves but these have now died out. Charles II is depicted extensively in art, literature and media. Charleston, South Carolina, and South Kingstown, Rhode Island, are named after him. King Charles's Island and Charles Island are previous names of both Floreana Island and Española Island in the Galapagos Archipelago, both in his honour. == Titles, styles, honours and arms == === Titles and styles === The official style of Charles II was \"Charles the Second, by the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.\"Guinness Book of Answers (1991), p. 708 The claim to France was only nominal, and had been asserted by every English monarch since Edward III, regardless of the amount of French territory actually controlled. === Honours === * KG: Knight of the Garter, 21 May 1638 === Arms === Charles's coat of arms as Prince of Wales was the royal arms (which he later inherited), differenced by a label of three points Argent.

He was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. He was the last Catholic monarch of England, Scotland and Ireland. His reign is now remembered primarily for conflicts over religious tolerance, but it also involved struggles over the principles of absolutism and the divine right of kings. His deposition ended a century of political and civil strife in England by confirming the primacy of the English Parliament over the Crown. James succeeded to the thrones of England, Ireland and Scotland following the death of his brother, with widespread support in all three countries, largely because the principles of eligibility based on divine right and birth were widely accepted. Tolerance of his personal Catholicism did not extend to tolerance of Catholicism in general, and the English and Scottish parliaments refused to pass his measures. When James attempted to impose them by decree, this was met with opposition; some academics have, however, argued that it was a political principle, rather than a religious one, that ultimately led to his removal. In June 1688, two events turned dissent into a crisis. Firstly, the birth of James's son and heir James Francis Edward on 10 June raised the prospect of establishing a Catholic dynasty and excluding his Anglican daughter Mary and her Protestant husband William III of Orange from the line of succession. Secondly, the prosecution of the Seven Bishops for seditious libel was viewed as further evidence of an assault on the Church of England, and their acquittal on 30 June destroyed his political authority in England.

Originally ruling as duke, he was raised to the rank of grand duke in 1815. Prior to succeeding to the throne, he served as Governor of Hanover from 1776 to 1786. ==Early life and service in Hanover== Duke Charles Louis Frederick of Mecklenburg was born in Mirow, the second son of Duke Charles Louis Frederick of Mecklenburg and his wife Princess Elisabeth Albertine of Saxe- Hildburghausen. On 11 December 1752 his uncle Adolphus Frederick III died and was succeeded by Charles's older brother, who became Adolphus Frederick IV. With his brother's accession Charles was taken with the rest of the family from Mirow to the capital Strelitz. From the age of four, Charles looked set for a career in Hanoverian service after being given a Captain's commission. His sister Charlotte married the Elector of Hanover, King George III of the United Kingdom on 8 September 1761. Charles made frequent visits to his sister in Great Britain and he ultimately entered the service of his brother-in-law the Elector of Hanover with a chief military appointment at Hanover following service in Spain. In the autumn of 1776, Charles was appointed governor- general of Hanover by his brother-in-law. As Governor of Hanover, Charles effectively held all the powers of a sovereign ruler. His brother-in-law had no wish to reside in Germany, being thoroughly English. Shortly after being widowed for a second time in December 1785, Charles requested permission to retire from his military employments in Hanover and resign the governorship. His brother-in-law granted his request, promoted Charles to the rank of field marshal and granted him a pension.

He was the son of Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine, and Charlotte of Hesse-Kassel. == Rule == His short reign was not glamorous. He appointed his incompetent former tutor Paul Hachenberg as chief minister, leaving his half-siblings, the \"Raugraves\", out of favour. He brought back his mother from Kassel and paid her immense debts. Charles was of a weak and timid nature, marked by familial childhood experiences. He showed a superficial enthusiasm for military life. Charles was a strict Calvinist. In 1671, his aunt, Electress Sophia of Hanover, arranged his marriage to Princess Wilhelmine Ernestine of Denmark, daughter of King Frederick III of Denmark. Their marriage was childless. Upon his death, the Electoral Palatinate passed to the Catholic Neuburg branch of the family. The rival claims to the Palatinate of his sister, Elizabeth Charlotte, Duchess of Orleans, Louis XIV of France's sister-in-law, was the pretext for the French invasion of the Palatinate in 1688, which began the Nine Years War. == Ancestry == ==References== Category:1651 births Category:1685 deaths Category:Nobility from Heidelberg Category:House of Palatinate-Simmern Category:Prince-electors of the Palatinate Category:Burials at the Church of the Holy Spirit, Heidelberg\n\nID: 6\nTitle: 1660 in England\nContent: time since its abolition in 1649. * 1 May – the Declaration of Breda is presented to the Parliament of England which acknowledges that the lawful government of the nation is by King, Lords and Commons. * 8 May – Parliament declares that Charles has been lawful King of England since 1649 and invites him to return. * 15 May – John Thurloe is arrested for high treason. * 19 May – the newly restored Church of England Convocation of the English Clergy canonises King Charles I as King Charles the Martyr and Saint Charles Stuart, the only saint formally canonised within the Anglican Communion. * 23 May (2 June N.S.) – Charles II embarks from Scheveningen on , captained by Edward Montagu (created Earl of Sandwich two months later). * 25 May – Charles II lands at Dover. * 29 May – Charles II arrives in London and assumes the throne, marking the beginning of the English Restoration, commemorated as Oak Apple Day. * 25 June – General Post Office established by Charles II. * 29 June – John Thurloe is released. * 27 July – Regicides William Goffe and Edward Whalley, fleeing the country, arrive in Massachusetts. * 2 August – Charles II issues a grant for two theatre companies: a King's Company under his own patronage, led by Thomas Killigrew, and a Duke's Company under the patronage of his brother, the Duke of York, led by Sir William Davenant. * 27 August – the books of John Milton are burnt because of his attacks on King Charles II. * 29 August – Indemnity and Oblivion Act passes into law, granting indemnities to those who had been active in the Interregnum (other than regicides). * September – William Juxon appointed as Archbishop\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick\nContent: in the Saratoga campaign, under British general John Burgoyne. Burgoyne was defeated in the Battles of Saratoga (1777), and his troops were taken captive as the Convention Army. Although the terms of surrender allowed the Convention Army to give their parole and return to Europe, the American Continental Congress revoked the convention. The Convention Army was kept in captivity until the war ended in 1783. === Reign === Charles I died in 1780, at which point Charles William Ferdinand inherited the throne. He soon became known as a model sovereign, a typical enlightened despot of the period, characterized by economy and prudence. The duke's combination of interest in the well-being of his subjects and habitual caution led to a policy of gradual reforms, a successful middle way between the conservatism of some contemporary monarchs and the over-enthusiastic wholesale changes pursued by others. He sponsored enlightenment arts and sciences; most notably he was patron to the young mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, paying for him to attend university against the wishes of Gauss' father.Dunnington, G.

Given a circle of radius , it is possible to partition the circle into sectors, as shown in the figure to the right. Each sector is approximately triangular in shape, and the sectors can be rearranged to form an approximate parallelogram. The height of this parallelogram is , and the width is half the circumference of the circle, or . Thus, the total area of the circle is : : (circle). Though the dissection used in this formula is only approximate, the error becomes smaller and smaller as the circle is partitioned into more and more sectors. The limit of the areas of the approximate parallelograms is exactly , which is the area of the circle. This argument is actually a simple application of the ideas of calculus. In ancient times, the method of exhaustion was used in a similar way to find the area of the circle, and this method is now recognized as a precursor to integral calculus. Using modern methods, the area of a circle can be computed using a definite integral: :A \\;=\\;2\\int_{-r}^r \\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\\,dx \\;=\\; \\pi r^2. ====Ellipses==== The formula for the area enclosed by an ellipse is related to the formula of a circle; for an ellipse with semi- major and semi-minor axes and the formula is: :A = \\pi xy . ===Non-planar surface area=== Most basic formulas for surface area can be obtained by cutting surfaces and flattening them out (see: developable surfaces). For example, if the side surface of a cylinder (or any prism) is cut lengthwise, the surface can be flattened out\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Area of a circle\nContent: text: In geometry, the area enclosed by a circle of radius is . Here the Greek letter represents the constant ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter, approximately equal to 3.14159. One method of deriving this formula, which originated with Archimedes, involves viewing the circle as the limit of a sequence of regular polygons with an increasing number of sides. The area of a regular polygon is half its perimeter multiplied by the distance from its center to its sides, and because the sequence tends to a circle, the corresponding formula-that the area is half the circumference times the radius-namely, , holds for a circle. ==Terminology== Although often referred to as the area of a circle in informal contexts, strictly speaking the term disk refers to the interior region of the circle, while circle is reserved for the boundary only, which is a curve and covers no area itself. Therefore, the area of a disk is the more precise phrase for the area enclosed by a circle. ==History== Modern mathematics can obtain the area using the methods of integral calculus or its more sophisticated offspring, real analysis. However, the area of a disk was studied by the Ancient Greeks. Eudoxus of Cnidus in the fifth century B.C. had found that the area of a disk is proportional to its radius squared. Archimedes used the tools of Euclidean geometry to show that the area inside a circle is equal to that of a right triangle whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius in his book Measurement of a Circle. The circumference is 2r, and the area of a triangle is half the base times the height, yielding the area r2 for\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Area\nContent: = 10−28 square meters.

In India, * 20 dhurki = 1 dhur * 20 dhur = 1 khatha * 20 khata = 1 bigha * 32 khata = 1 acre ==History== ===Circle area=== In the 5th century BCE, Hippocrates of Chios was the first to show that the area of a disk (the region enclosed by a circle) is proportional to the square of its diameter, as part of his quadrature of the lune of Hippocrates, but did not identify the constant of proportionality. Eudoxus of Cnidus, also in the 5th century BCE, also found that the area of a disk is proportional to its radius squared. Subsequently, Book I of Euclid's Elements dealt with equality of areas between two-dimensional figures. The mathematician Archimedes used the tools of Euclidean geometry to show that the area inside a circle is equal to that of a right triangle whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius, in his book Measurement of a Circle. (The circumference is 2r, and the area of a triangle is half the base times the height, yielding the area r2 for the disk.) Archimedes approximated the value of π (and hence the area of a unit-radius circle) with his doubling method, in which he inscribed a regular triangle in a circle and noted its area, then doubled the number of sides to give a regular hexagon, then repeatedly doubled the number of sides as the polygon's area got closer and closer to that of the circle (and did the same with circumscribed polygons). ===Triangle area=== ===Quadrilateral area=== In\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Circle\nContent: comes to multiplied by the radius squared: :\\mathrm{Area} = \\pi r^2.\\, Equivalently, denoting diameter by d, :\\mathrm{Area} = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4} \\approx 0{.}7854d^2, that is, approximately 79% of the circumscribing square (whose side is of length d). The circle is the plane curve enclosing the maximum area for a given arc length. This relates the circle to a problem in the calculus of variations, namely the isoperimetric inequality. ===Equations=== ====Cartesian coordinates==== thumb|right|Circle of radius r = 1, centre (a, b) = (1.2, −0.5) ;Equation of a circle In an x–y Cartesian coordinate system, the circle with centre coordinates (a, b) and radius r is the set of all points (x, y) such that : (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2. This equation, known as the equation of the circle, follows from the Pythagorean theorem applied to any point on the circle: as shown in the adjacent diagram, the radius is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose other sides are of length |x − a| and |y − b|. If the circle is centred at the origin (0, 0), then the equation simplifies to : x^2 + y^2 = r^2. ;Parametric form The equation can be written in parametric form using the trigonometric functions sine and cosine as : x = a + r\\,\\cos t, : y = b + r\\,\\sin t, where t is a parametric variable in the range 0 to 2, interpreted geometrically as the angle that the ray from (a, b) to (x, y) makes with the positive x axis.

By Green's theorem, this is the same as the outward flux of r across the circle bounding D: :A = \\frac 1 2 \\oint_{\\partial D} \\mathbf r\\cdot\\mathbf n\\, ds where n is the unit normal and ds is the arc length measure. For a circle of radius R centered at the origin, we have |\\mathbf r|=R and \\mathbf n=\\mathbf r/R, so the above equality is :A = \\frac 1 2\\oint_{\\partial D} \\mathbf r\\cdot\\frac{\\mathbf r}{R}\\, ds = \\frac{R}{2}\\oint_{\\partial D} \\,ds. The integral of ds over the whole circle \\partial D is just the arc length, which is its circumference, so this shows that the area A enclosed by the circle is equal to R/2 times the circumference of the circle. Another proof that uses triangles considers the area enclosed by a circle to be made up of an infinite number of triangles (i.e. the triangles each have an angle of at the centre of the circle), each with an area of (derived from the expression for the area of a triangle: ). Note that due to small angle approximation. Through summing the areas of the triangles, the expression for the area of the circle can therefore be found: \\begin{align} \\mathrm{Area}&{}= \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\, d \\theta \\\\\\ &{}= \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\theta \\right]_{0}^{2 \\pi}\\\\\\ &{}= \\pi r^2. \\end{align} ===Semicircle proof=== Note that the area of a semicircle of radius r can be computed by the integral \\int_{-r}^r \\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\\,dx. frame|A semicircle of radius r By trigonometric substitution, we substitute x=r \\sin\\theta\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Method of exhaustion\nContent: a polygon of a greater area and greater number of sides.

He also provided the bounds 3 + 10/71 < π < 3 + 10/70, (giving a range of 1/497) by comparing the perimeters of the circle with the perimeters of the inscribed and circumscribed 96-sided regular polygons. Other results he obtained with the method of exhaustion included * The area bounded by the intersection of a line and a parabola is 4/3 that of the triangle having the same base and height(the quadrature of the parabola); * The area of an ellipse is proportional to a rectangle having sides equal to its major and minor axes; * The volume of a sphere is 4 times that of a cone having a base of the same radius and height equal to this radius; * The volume of a cylinder having a height equal to its diameter is 3/2 that of a sphere having the same diameter; * The area bounded by one spiral rotation and a line is 1/3 that of the circle having a radius equal to the line segment length; * Use of the method of exhaustion also led to the successful evaluation of an infinite geometric series (for the first time); == See also == * The Method of Mechanical Theorems * The Quadrature of the Parabola * Trapezoidal rule * Pythagorean Theorem == References == Category:Volume Category:Euclidean geometry Category:Integral\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Approximations of π\nContent: the area of a circle of radius , by 2 to find the approximation of .

The procedure for finding the radius of the enclosing circle is as follows: Open the sector and set the crosswise distance at the point 6–6 on the polygraphic lines to the desired side length. The distance measured crosswise at n on the polygraphic lines is the radius of the enclosing circle. ===The tetragonic lines=== The tetragonic lines are marked from 13 down to 3 as you move away from the pivot, and the distance from the pivot can be inferred to be L(n) = L_t \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{\\sqrt{3}\\tan\\frac{180}{n}}}, where L_t is the distance from the pivot to the point marked 3. There is a circle on the scale that lies nearly midway between 6 and 7. The name comes from tetragon (quadrilateral), as the main purpose of these lines is the quadrature of regular polygons, that is, finding the side of a square whose area is the same as the given regular polygon. They can also be used to square the circle. The area of a regular polygon with n sides is A(n) = L^2 \\frac{n}{4\\tan\\frac{180}{n}}, where L is the side length of the polygon.

Ptolemy's 2nd-century Geography used the same prime meridian but measured latitude from the Equator instead. After their work was translated into Arabic in the 9th century, Al-Khwārizmī's Book of the Description of the Earth corrected Marinus' and Ptolemy's errors regarding the length of the Mediterranean Sea, causing medieval Arabic cartography to use a prime meridian around 10° east of Ptolemy's line. Mathematical cartography resumed in Europe following Maximus Planudes' recovery of Ptolemy's text a little before 1300; the text was translated into Latin at Florence by Jacopo d'Angelo around 1407. In 1884, the United States hosted the International Meridian Conference, attended by representatives from twenty-five nations. Twenty-two of them agreed to adopt the longitude of the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England as the zero-reference line. The Dominican Republic voted against the motion, while France and Brazil abstained. France adopted Greenwich Mean Time in place of local determinations by the Paris Observatory in 1911. ==Latitude and longitude== thumb|upright=1.2|Diagram of the latitude and longitude angle measurements for a spherical model of the Earth. The \"latitude\" (abbreviation: Lat., , or phi) of a point on Earth's surface is the angle between the equatorial plane and the straight line that passes through that point and through (or close to) the center of the Earth. Lines joining points of the same latitude trace circles on the surface of Earth called parallels, as they are parallel to the Equator and to each other.

America's (that is, South America's) status as a separate island or a part of Asia, specifically, the peninsula of India Superior upon which Cattigara was situated, is left unresolved. As the question of which of the two alternative concepts was correct had not been resolved at the time, both were represented on the same map.

Cellular respiration may be described as a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert chemical energy from nutrients into ATP, and then release waste products. The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, producing large amounts of energy (ATP). Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity. The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, some of which are redox reactions. Although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction, it is an unusual one because of the slow, controlled release of energy from the series of reactions. Nutrients that are commonly used by animal and plant cells in respiration include sugar, amino acids and fatty acids, and the most common oxidizing agent is molecular oxygen (O2). The chemical energy stored in ATP (the bond of its third phosphate group to the rest of the molecule can be broken allowing more stable products to form, thereby releasing energy for use by the cell) can then be used to drive processes requiring energy, including biosynthesis, locomotion or transportation of molecules across cell membranes. == Aerobic respiration == Aerobic respiration requires oxygen (O2) in order to create ATP. Although carbohydrates, fats and proteins are consumed as reactants, aerobic respiration is the preferred method of pyruvate production in glycolysis, and requires pyruvate to the mitochondria in order to be fully oxidized by the citric acid cycle. The products of this process are\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Ecosystem respiration\nContent: text: thumb|upright=1.2| Ecosystem respiration is the sum of all respiration occurring by the living organisms in a specific ecosystem. The two main processes that contribute to ecosystem respiration are photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Photosynthesis uses carbon-dioxide and water, in the presence of sunlight to produce glucose and oxygen whereas cellular respiration uses glucose and oxygen to produce carbon-dioxide, water, and energy. The coordination of inputs and outputs of these two processes creates a completely interconnected system, constituting the underlying functioning of the ecosystems overall respiration. It is the operation in which the organisms within a specified ecosystem use the process of respiration to convert organic carbon to carbon dioxide. While the amount of respiration is varied upon the type of ecosystem and the community abundance, the mechanism occurs in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. == Overview == thumb|upright=1.2|right| Cellular respiration is the overall relationship between autotrophs and heterotrophs. Autotrophs are organisms that produce their own food through the process of photosynthesis, whereas heterotrophs are organisms that cannot prepare their own food and depend on autotrophs for nutrition. These two categories of living things work in coordination between photosynthesis and respiration as they both produce products that the other process utilizes. Cellular respiration happens when a cell takes glucose and oxygen and uses it to produce carbon dioxide, energy, and water. This transaction is important not only for the benefit of the cells, but for the carbon dioxide output provided, which is key in the process of photosynthesis. Without respiration, actions necessary to life, such as metabolic processes and photosynthesis, would cease. Ecosystem respiration is typically measured in the natural environment, such as a forest or grassland, rather than in the laboratory. Ecosystem respiration is the production portion of carbon\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Biology\nContent: cellular activity. The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, some of which are redox reactions. Although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction, it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a cell because of the slow, controlled release of energy from the series of reactions. Sugar in the form of glucose is the main nutrient used by animal and plant cells in respiration. Cellular respiration involving oxygen is called aerobic respiration, which has four stages: glycolysis, citric acid cycle (or Krebs cycle), electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation. Glycolysis is a metabolic process that occurs in the cytoplasm whereby glucose is converted into two pyruvates, with two net molecules of ATP being produced at the same time. Each pyruvate is then oxidized into acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which also generates NADH and carbon dioxide. Acetyl-Coa enters the citric acid cycle, which takes places inside the mitochondrial matrix. At the end of the cycle, the total yield from 1 glucose (or 2 pyruvates) is 6 NADH, 2 FADH2, and 2 ATP molecules. Finally, the next stage is oxidative phosphorylation, which in eukaryotes, occurs in the mitochondrial cristae. Oxidative phosphorylation comprises the electron transport chain, which is a series of four protein complexes that transfer electrons from one complex to another, thereby releasing energy from NADH and FADH2 that is coupled to the pumping of protons (hydrogen ions) across the inner mitochondrial membrane (chemiosmosis), which generates a proton motive force. Energy from the proton motive force drives the enzyme ATP synthase to synthesize more ATPs by phosphorylating ADPs. The transfer of electrons terminates with molecular oxygen being the final electron acceptor.

Carbon fixation is an endothermic redox reaction. In general outline, photosynthesis is the opposite of cellular respiration: while photosynthesis is a process of reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrates, cellular respiration is the oxidation of carbohydrates or other nutrients to carbon dioxide. Nutrients used in cellular respiration include carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acids. These nutrients are oxidized to produce carbon dioxide and water, and to release chemical energy to drive the organism's metabolism. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are distinct processes, as they take place through different sequences of chemical reactions and in different cellular compartments. The general equation for photosynthesis as first proposed by Cornelis van Niel is: : + + → + + Since water is used as the electron donor in oxygenic photosynthesis, the equation for this process is: : + + → + + This equation emphasizes that water is both a reactant in the light- dependent reaction and a product of the light-independent reaction, but canceling n water molecules from each side gives the net equation: : + + → + Other processes substitute other compounds (such as arsenite) for water in the electron-supply role; for example some microbes use sunlight to oxidize arsenite to arsenate:Anaerobic Photosynthesis, Chemical & Engineering News, 86, 33, August 18, 2008, p. 36 The equation for this reaction is: : + + → + (used to build other compounds in subsequent reactions) Photosynthesis occurs in two stages. In the first stage, light-dependent reactions or light reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the hydrogen carrier NADPH and the energy-storage\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Soil respiration\nContent: text: Soil respiration refers to the production of carbon dioxide when soil organisms respire. This includes respiration of plant roots, the rhizosphere, microbes and fauna. Soil respiration is a key ecosystem process that releases carbon from the soil in the form of CO2. CO2 is acquired by plants from the atmosphere and converted into organic compounds in the process of photosynthesis. Plants use these organic compounds to build structural components or respire them to release energy. When plant respiration occurs below-ground in the roots, it adds to soil respiration. Over time, plant structural components are consumed by heterotrophs. This heterotrophic consumption releases CO2 and when this CO2 is released by below-ground organisms, it is considered soil respiration. The amount of soil respiration that occurs in an ecosystem is controlled by several factors. The temperature, moisture, nutrient content and level of oxygen in the soil can produce extremely disparate rates of respiration. These rates of respiration can be measured in a variety of methods. Other methods can be used to separate the source components, in this case the type of photosynthetic pathway (C3/C4), of the respired plant structures. Soil respiration rates can be largely affected by human activity. This is because humans have the ability to and have been changing the various controlling factors of soil respiration for numerous years. Global climate change is composed of numerous changing factors including rising atmospheric CO2, increasing temperature and shifting precipitation patterns. All of these factors can affect the rate of global soil respiration. Increased nitrogen fertilization by humans also has the potential to affect rates over the entire planet. Soil respiration and its rate across ecosystems is extremely important to understand. This is because soil respiration plays a large role in global carbon cycling\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Chlororespiration\nContent: text: thumb|Chlororespiration basics|alt= Chlororespiration is a respiratory process that takes place within plants. Inside plant cells there is an organelle called the chloroplast which is surrounded by the thylakoid membrane. This membrane contains an enzyme called NAD(P)H dehydrogenase which transfers electrons in a linear chain to oxygen molecules. This electron transport chain (ETC) within the chloroplast also interacts with those in the mitochondria where respiration takes place. Photosynthesis is also a process that Chlororespiration interacts with. If photosynthesis is inhibited by environmental stressors like water deficit, increased heat, and/or increased/decreased light exposure, or even chilling stress then chlororespiration is one of the crucial ways that plants use to compensate for chemical energy synthesis. == Chlororespiration – the latest model == thumb|alt=|185x185px|left|A diagram depicting an early understanding of the process of chlororespiration Initially, the presence of chlororespiration as a legitimate respiratory process in plants was heavily doubted. However, experimentation on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, discovered Plastoquinone (PQ) to be a redox carrier. The role of this redox carrier is to transport electrons from the NAD(P)H enzyme to oxygen molecules on the thylakoid membrane. Using this cyclic electron chain around photosystem one (PS I), chlororespiration compensates for the lack of light. This cyclic pathway also allows electrons to re-enter the PQ pool through NAD(P)H enzyme activity and production, which is then used to supply ATP molecules (energy) to plant cells. thumb|255x255px|A diagram depicting newly discovered molecules (PTOX and the NDH complex) as part of the chlororespiratory process in higher order plants like Rosa Meillandina.

Respiration and Crop Productivity, Springer- Verlag. Because typically more than half of global terrestrial plant photosynthesis (or gross primary production) is used for plant respiration, more than one quarter of global terrestrial plant photosynthesis is presumably consumed in maintenance respiration. Maintenance respiration is a key component of most physiologically based mathematical models of plant growth, including models of crop growth and yield and models of ecosystem primary production and carbon balance.Canell MGR, Thornley JHM (2000) \"Modelling the components of plant respiration: some guiding principles\".

Photosynthesis is one of the most important biochemical processes for life on earth and its possible only due to the ability of plants to use energy from photons and convert it into molecules such as NADPH and ATP, to then fix carbon dioxide and make it into sugars that plants can use for their growth and development. But photosynthesis is not the only plant process driven by light, other processes such as photomorphology and plant photoperiod are extremely important for regulation of vegetative and reproductive growth as well as production of plant secondary metabolites. === Photosynthesis === Photosynthesis is defined as a series of biochemical reactions that phototrophic cells perform to transform light energy to chemical energy and store it in carbon-carbon bonds of carbohydrates. As it is widely known, this process happens inside of the chloroplast of photosynthetic plant cells where light absorbing pigments can be found embedded in the membranes of structures called thylakoids. There are 2 main pigments present in the Photosystems of higher plants: chlorophyll (a or b) and carotenes. These pigments are organized to maximize the light reception and transfer, and they absorb specific wavelengths to broaden the amount of light that can be captured and used for photo-redox reactions. ==== Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) ==== Due to the limited amount of pigments in plant photosynthetic cells, there is a limited range of wavelengths that plants can use to perform photosynthesis. This range is called \"Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR)\".

People who have excessive fearlessness would be mad (Aristotle remarks that some describe Celts this way). Aristotle also says that \"rash\" people (), those with excessive confidence, are generally cowards putting on a brave face. Aristotle notes that the term courage is sometimes misapplied to five other types of character: *Citizen-soldiers who display a quasi-courage that is motivated by penalties for disobedience, by hope of honors, or by fear of shame at being caught acting cowardly. Such motivations can make an army fight as if brave, but true courage is motivated by the love of the virtue, not by such external motives. Aristotle notes that Homeric heroes such as Hector had this type of courage. *People who are experienced in dealing with some particular danger often seem courageous, though it's really their skill rather than their courage which gives them confidence. *Passion or anger () can look like courage. People who exhibit can be blind to dangers, but unlike truly courageous people they are not aiming at virtue. Aristotle notes however that this is \"something akin to courage\" and if it were combined with deliberate choice and purpose it would seem to be true courage. *The boldness of someone who feels confident based on many past victories is not true courage. Like a person who is overconfident when drunk, this apparent courage is based on a lack of fear (not confidence in the face of fear), and will disappear if circumstances change. *People who are overconfident simply due to ignorance of the danger can mimic courage. Avoiding fear is more important when aiming at courage\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Martin Seligman\nContent: to attempt to distill a manageable list of virtues that have been highly valued from ancient China and India, through Greece and Rome, to contemporary Western cultures. Their list includes six character strengths: wisdom/knowledge, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence. Each of these has three to five sub- entries; for instance, temperance includes forgiveness, humility, prudence, and self-regulation. The authors do not believe that there is a hierarchy for the six virtues; no one is more fundamental than or a precursor to the others. ==Well-being== In his book Flourish, 2011, Seligman wrote on \"Well-Being Theory\", and said, with respect to how he measures well-being: > Each element of well-being must itself have three properties to count as an > element: # It contributes to well-being. # Many people pursue it for its own > sake, not merely to get any of the other elements. # It is defined and > measured independently of the other elements. He concluded that there are five elements to \"well-being\", which fall under the mnemonic PERMA: * Positive emotion—Can only be assessed subjectively * Engagement—Like positive emotion, can only be measured through subjective means. It is presence of a flow state * Relationships—The presence of friends, family, intimacy, or social connection * Meaning—Belonging to and serving something bigger than one's self * Achievement—Accomplishment that is pursued even when it brings no positive emotion, no meaning, and nothing in the way of positive relationships. These theories have not been empirically validated. In July 2011, Seligman encouraged the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, to look into well-being as well as financial wealth in ways of assessing the prosperity of a nation.

Aristotle also mentions several other traits: * Gnome (good sense) – passing judgment, \"sympathetic understanding\" * Synesis (understanding) – comprehending what others say, does not issue commands * Phronesis (practical wisdom) – knowledge of what to do, knowledge of changing truths, issues commands * Techne (art, craftsmanship) Aristotle's list is not the only list, however.

In contrast, philosopher Walter Kaufmann proposed as the four cardinal virtues: ambition/humility; love; courage; and honesty.Kaufmann, W., 1961. The Faith Of A Heretic. Doubleday & Co., pp. 317–338.

(1933) Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non- aristotelian Systems and General Semantics. Institute of General Semantics. ===Use of adjectives=== The development of this instrument provides an interesting insight into the broader area between linguistics and psychology. People have been describing each other since they developed the ability to speak. Most adjectives can also be used as personality descriptors. The occurrence of thousands of adjectives in English is an attestation of the subtleties in descriptions of persons and their behavior available to speakers of English. Roget's Thesaurus is an early attempt to classify most adjectives into categories and was used within this context to reduce the number of adjectives to manageable subsets, suitable for factor analysis. ===Factors of Evaluation, Potency, and Activity=== Osgood and his colleagues performed a factor analysis of large collections of semantic differential scales and found three recurring attitudes that people use to evaluate words and phrases: evaluation, potency, and activity. Evaluation loads highest on the adjective pair 'good-bad'. The 'strong-weak' adjective pair defines the potency factor. Adjective pair 'active-passive' defines the activity factor. These three dimensions of affective meaning were found to be cross-cultural universals in a study of dozens of cultures. This factorial structure makes intuitive sense. When our ancestors encountered a person, the initial perception had to be whether that person represents a danger. Is the person good or bad? Next, is the person strong or weak? Our reactions to a person markedly differ if perceived as good and strong, good and weak, bad and weak, or bad and strong. Subsequently, we might extend our initial classification to include cases of persons who actively threaten us\n\nID: 6\nTitle: San Sebastian Stags\nContent: A Christian should do no less. Even as he evades the temptations of the consumeristic and materialistic establishments, he should guide the owners and consumers out of the jungle of sin to the cleared area of salvation. ==Bravo== Literally, it means, “brave” a word taken from “bravura” which means “courage”. But courage does no mean being the “siga-siga” type who does not run away from a fight. It means evading or running away from dangers of his soul. A coward runs away with a trembling heart and a broken spirit. A courageous man runs away with a firm heart, a strong faith and triumphant soul, and we salute this type of man. ==Colors== The colors Red and Gold were adopted as to identify San Sebastian College during the National College Athletic Association. Red symbolizes sacrifice, martyrdom, bravery and baptism. The element of Gold represented by its shimmering color, on the other hand, stands for endurance and the perennial quest for high standards – inner strength in the quest for excellence – symbolic of the loyal dignity of a true Christian. Thus, the Sebastinian renders sacrifices and, in a way, martyrdom, for he submits himself to the pains of rigorous training and discipline in his quest for glory. This entails bravery not only in fighting for victory but in accepting defeat graciously as well; and endurance to be able to withstand pain. ==Corporate support== In 2016, Foton Motor Philippines, the exclusive distributor of Foton motor vehicles in the Philippines signed an agreement to support the athletics program of the San Sebastian College and helping in the growth and success of the school athletes.

The six core values are the broadest category and are, “core characteristics valued by moral philosophers and religious thinkers”. Peterson and Seligman then moved down the hierarchy to identify character strengths, which are “the psychological processes or mechanisms that define the virtues”. The researchers began identifying individual character strengths by brainstorming with a group of noted positive psychology scholars. This exercise generated a list of human strengths, which were helpful when consulting with Gallup Organization. Peterson and Seligman then performed an exhaustive literature search for work that directly addresses good character in the domains of, “psychiatry, youth development, philosophy, and psychology”. Some individuals who influenced Peterson's and Seligman's choice of strengths include: Abraham Maslow, Erik Erikson, Ellen Greenberger, Marie Jahoda, Carol Ryff, Michael Cawley, Howard Gardner, and Shalom Schwartz. The researchers also looked for virtue-laden messages in popular culture. For example, the researchers examined Hallmark greeting cards, personal ads, graffiti, bumper stickers, and profiles of Pokémon characters. After identifying dozens of \"candidate strengths\", the researchers refined their list by subjecting them to a list of ten criteria (e.g., strengths must contribute to a sense of a fulfilling life, must be intrinsically valuable) to help them select the final 24 strengths for the CSV. Approximately half of the strengths included in the CSV meet all 10 criteria, and half do not. By looking for similarities between candidate strengths, the researchers distributed 24 character strengths between six virtue categories.

Deforestation puts at risk all aspects of the environment, the economy, and the well-being of the citizens of the country. Deforestation can also lead to another issue called forest degradation. This phrase describes a forest that is still present but has suffered such severe degradation from soil erosion, nutrient loss, and/or the extinction of specific plant and animal species that it is unable to perform as it once did. Both wildlife and human life are no longer supported by these degraded woodlands. Given that around 6.5 million square miles of forest are in high danger of such deterioration over the next ten years, this issue offers an even bigger threat to life on this planet than mere deforestation. Degradation is also greatly influenced by climate change, which is characterized by rising temperatures and erratic weather patterns. Additionally, it can lead to an increase in the frequency and severity of disease, pest infestations, and forest fires. https://www.greenmatters.com/p/deforestation-vs- logging#:~:text=If%20we%20examine%20the%20strictest,of%20its%20associated%20life%20forms. === Impact of logging on deforestation === Deforestation includes logging, which involves cutting down trees, processing them locally, and loading them into trucks. The latter is a silvicultural endeavor with outcomes comparable to those of deforestation. This process of logging involves removing trees from the forest, and when done for commercial gain, it entails extensive activities and contributes significantly to world deforestation.Lawrence, P. et al (2012). Simulating the biogeochemical and biogeophysical impacts of transient land cover change and wood harvest in the community climate system model (CCSM4) from 1850 to 2100.

Industries that provide the global market with wood varieties including\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Habitat destruction\nContent: other anthropogenic changes to the characteristics of land. Habitat degradation, fragmentation, and pollution are aspects of habitat destruction caused by humans that do not necessarily involve over destruction of habitat, yet result in habitat collapse. Desertification, deforestation, and coral reef degradation are specific types of habitat destruction for those areas (deserts, forests, coral reefs). Geist and Lambin (2002) assessed 152 case studies of net losses of tropical forest cover to determine any patterns in the proximate and underlying causes of tropical deforestation. Their results, yielded as percentages of the case studies in which each parameter was a significant factor, provide a quantitative prioritization of which proximate and underlying causes were the most significant. The proximate causes were clustered into broad categories of agricultural expansion (96%), infrastructure expansion (72%), and wood extraction (67%). Therefore, according to this study, forest conversion to agriculture is the main land use change responsible for tropical deforestation. The specific categories reveal further insight into the specific causes of tropical deforestation: transport extension (64%), commercial wood extraction (52%), permanent cultivation (48%), cattle ranching (46%), shifting (slash and burn) cultivation (41%), subsistence agriculture (40%), and fuel wood extraction for domestic use (28%). One result is that shifting cultivation is not the primary cause of deforestation in all world regions, while transport extension (including the construction of new roads) is the largest single proximate factor responsible for deforestation. === Global warming === Rising global temperatures, caused by the greenhouse effect, contribute to habitat destruction, endangering various species, such as the polar bear. Melting ice caps promote rising sea levels and floods which threaten natural habitats and species globally. ===Drivers=== While the above- mentioned activities are the proximal or direct causes of habitat destruction in\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Deforestation and climate change\nContent: of deforestation can be mediated when these trees are planted. === Reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation === Recognition of the negative impacts of deforestation and of the overwhelming evidence of global warming has led to the development of international policy surrounding the conservation of forests. One attempt towards fighting climate change globally is the Reducing Emissions for Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) efforts, and a few countries are already starting to implement and analyze ways to protect standing trees. In the case of the Bac Kan province in Vietnam, researchers came up with systems to encourage leaving forests intact while also meeting international, national, and individual investments successfully. Their methods included \"benefit-distribution systems\" and dividends for ecosystem services. The researchers hope that their results \"can be replicated and directly contribute to reducing carbon emissions globally.\"Hoang, M. H., et al. \"Benefit distribution across scales to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) in Vietnam.\" Land Use Policy, vol 31, 6 September 2011, pp. 48-60. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2011.09.013 == Human dimension of deforestation and climate change == Deforestation is often described as the changing of land from forested to non-forested by means both natural and unnatural. The relationship between deforestation and climate change is one of a positive feedback loop. The more trees that are removed equals larger effects of climate change which, in turn, results in the loss of more trees. In recent history, this process has been accelerated and amplified by humans in many different ways. These include logging, urbanization, mining, and agricultural development. One of the more recent and bigger consequences of deforestation is wildfires, which leads to greater harm to humans and animals. Fires release carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides that affect air quality\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Land change science\nContent: examples of land use and land cover change that play a key role in the social and economic dimensions of land change science. === Tropical deforestation === Deforestation, in the context of land change science, is the systematic and permanent conversion of previously forested land for other uses. It has historically been a primary facilitator of land use and land cover change, is a particular focus of land change science. Forests are a vital part of the global ecosystem and are essential to carbon capture, ecological processes, and biodiversity. However, since the invention of agriculture, global forest cover has diminished by 35%. Further, tropical forests in particular support at least two-thirds of the world's biodiversity, and sustained changes in land cover in these regions are believed to be contributing to a mass extinction. Given the severe ecological consequences resulting from human-driven forest land use conversion, as well as the continuing downward trend in forest cover, to effectively model and evaluate patterns of land use change, scientists must also study the social and economic drivers of deforestation itself. Land use and land cover change resulting from deforestation is primarily the effect of large-scale socio-economic processes. Importantly, there is rarely one direct or underlying cause for deforestation. Rather, deforestation is the result of intertwining systemic forces working simultaneously or sequentially to change land cover. For instance, mass deforestation is often viewed as the product of industrial agriculture, yet a considerable portion old-growth forest deforestation is the result of small-scale migrant farming. As forest cover is removed, forest resources become exhausted and increasing populations lead to scarcity, which prompts people to move again to previously undisturbed forest, restarting the process of deforestation. This process is referred to as rural- to-rural migration. There are several reasons\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Deforestation\nContent: and agro-chemicals, are highly self-maintaining, highly productive, and with strong positive impact on soil and water quality, and biodiversity. Also, due to the environmental impact of meat production and milk production, production of meat analogues and milk substitutes (fermentation, single-cell protein, ...) is being explored. This may or may not effect the economics of cattle farming as well (along with soy production and exports, as a portion of it is used as fodder for cattle). ===Monitoring deforestation=== There are multiple methods that are appropriate and reliable for reducing and monitoring deforestation. One method is the \"visual interpretation of aerial photos or satellite imagery that is labor-intensive but does not require high-level training in computer image processing or extensive computational resources\". Another method includes hot-spot analysis (that is, locations of rapid change) using expert opinion or coarse resolution satellite data to identify locations for detailed digital analysis with high resolution satellite images. Deforestation is typically assessed by quantifying the amount of area deforested, measured at the present time. From an environmental point of view, quantifying the damage and its possible consequences is a more important task, while conservation efforts are more focused on forested land protection and development of land- use alternatives to avoid continued deforestation. Deforestation rate and total area deforested have been widely used for monitoring deforestation in many regions, including the Brazilian Amazon deforestation monitoring by INPE. A global satellite view is available, an example of land change science monitoring of land cover over time. Satellite imaging has become crucial in obtaining data on levels of deforestation and reforestation. Landsat satellite data, for example, has been used to map tropical deforestation as part of NASA's Landsat Pathfinder Humid Tropical Deforestation Project. The project yielded deforestation maps for\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Wildlife conservation\nContent: and smaller populations are more likely to go extinct.The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant shift in human behavior, resulting in mandatory and voluntary limitations on movement. As a result, people have started utilizing green spaces more frequently, which were previously habitats for wildlife. Unfortunately, this increased human activity has caused destruction to the natural habitat of various species. === Deforestation === Deforestation is the clearing and cutting down forests on purpose. Deforestation is a cause of human-induced habitat action destruction, by cutting down habitats of different species in the process of removing trees. Deforestation is often done for several reasons, often for either agricultural purposes or for logging, which is the obtainment of timber and wood for use in construction or fuel. Deforestation causes many threats to wildlife as it not only causes habitat destruction for the many animals that survive in forests, as more than 80% of the world's species live in forests but also leads to further climate change. Deforestation is a main concern in the tropical forests of the world. Tropical forests, like the Amazon, are home to the most biodiversity out of any other biome, making deforestation there an even more prevalent issue, especially in populated areas, as in these areas deforestation leads to habitat destruction and the endangerment of many species in one area. Some policies have been enacted to attempt to stop deforestation in different parts of the world, like the Wilderness Act of 1964 which designated specific areas wilderness to be protected. === Overexploitation === Overexploitation is the harvesting of animals and plants at a rate that's faster than the species' ability to recover. While often associated with Overfishing, overexploitation can apply to many groups including mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and plants. The\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Effects of deforestation on the paper industry in Nigeria\nContent: maintaining a balanced ecosystem and provide vital ecosystem services. The removal of trees contributes to habitat fragmentation, impacting various species, including plants, birds, mammals, and insects. Soil Erosion: Forests act as natural barriers against soil erosion by holding the soil together and absorbing water. Deforestation disrupts this natural process, making the land susceptible to erosion and runoff. In Nigeria, the loss of forests has led to increased soil degradation, reduced fertility, and increased sedimentation in rivers, which affects water quality and availability. Climate Change: Trees play a vital role in mitigating climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. The loss of forests significantly affects the carbon cycle, leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, deforestation in Nigeria contributes to climate change, exacerbating global warming and its associated consequences. == Economic Impacts == Reduced Timber Supply: The paper industry in Nigeria heavily relies on timber resources extracted from forests. Deforestation diminishes the availability of timber, leading to a decrease in the supply of raw materials for the paper industry. As a result, paper manufacturers face challenges in meeting market demands, leading to potential economic losses. Increased Cost of Production: Scarce timber supply due to deforestation increases the cost of raw materials for the paper industry. Manufacturers may need to explore alternative sources, potentially importing timber, thereby increasing production costs. These increased costs are ultimately passed down to consumers in the form of higher paper prices.

Employment and Livelihoods: The paper industry\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Socioeconomics\nContent: is a major cause of environmental change. Deforestation can be attributed to population growth, change in household dynamics, and resource management. Forests are traditionally owned by the state and control resource management which means their government is responsible for the development of forested land. Between 1970 and 2011, tree coverage decreased by 20.6%. The decrease can be attributed to community development and increased use of resources. The issue of deforestation is contributing to climate change because the wood is frequently burned and used as timber fuel which emits into the atmosphere. Deforestation is also happening due to population growth and the expansion of farmland which creates feedback loops. When forests are cut down to begin agriculture practices, soil degradation often takes place and leads to further issues like declining crop yields, which can contribute to food insecurity and contraction in the economy. * Due to deforestation, animals often lose their habitats and vegetation is significantly decreased. Habitat loss is common when deforestation happens because not only are the trees being cut down, but the land trees previously inhabited suffer extreme soil erosion due to lack of protection from the tree coverage. Animals' struggle to survive is further hindered due to high temperatures in places where tree coverage is lost. Local community economies are affected by this because they depend on these resources to drive their local markets and feed their families. Modern medicine is also affected by deforestation because several medicines are derived from plants found in these areas. Loss of these resources means a loss of income to local communities who depend on these natural resources for profit. This can have a global effect by creating shortages of some medicines worldwide. ==== Pollution ==== * Ocean pollution has massively affected small fishing communities around the world.

One underutilized, but potentially very powerful means to reduce household energy consumption is to provide real-time feedback to homeowners so they can effectively alter their energy using behavior. Low-cost energy feedback displays, such as the Energy Detective or Wattvision, have become available. A study of a similar device deployed in 500 homes in Ontario, Canada, by Hydro One showed an average 6.5% drop in total electricity use when compared with a similarly sized control group.ChartwellHydroOneMonitoringProgram.pdf Another technique is to ask homeowners to conserve energy in real time at times of peak demand, when relatively dirty power plants would otherwise need to be turned on. Standby power used by consumer electronics and appliances while they are turned off accounts for an estimated 5 to 10% of household electricity consumption, adding an estimated $3 billion to annual energy costs in the US. \"In the average home, 75% of the electricity used to power home electronics is consumed while the products are turned off.\"home_office.html ===Home energy consumption averages=== Home energy consumption averagesUS Dept. of Energy, \"Buildings Energy Data Book \" (2011) Sector Percentage Notes Home heating systems 28.9% Home cooling systems 14.0% Water heating 12.9% Lighting 9.0% Home electronics 7.1% Refrigerators and freezers 5.9% Clothing and dish washers 4.5% includes clothes dryers, does not include hot water Cookings 3.7% Computers 2.2% Other 4.4% includes small electrics, heating elements, motors, pool and hot tub heaters, outdoor grills, and natural gas outdoor lighting Non end-user energy expenditure 5.4% Energy usage in some homes may vary widely from these averages.

This schedule can be achieved after user habits regarding appliance use are understood. Most energy providers divide the energy tariff into high and low- price hours; therefore, scheduling an appliance to work an off-peak hour will significantly reduce electricity bills. == User Activity Detection == User activity detection leads to the precise detection of appliances required for an activity. If an appliance is active but not required for a user's current activity, it wastes energy and can be turned off to conserve energy. The precise identification of user activities is necessary to achieve this method of energy conservation. ==Energy conservation opportunities by sector== === Buildings === ==== Existing buildings ==== Energy conservation measures have primarily focused on technological innovations to improve efficiencies and financial incentives with theoretical explanations obtained from the mentioned analytical traditions. Existing buildings can improve energy efficiency by changing structural maintenance materials, adjusting the composition of air conditioning systems, selecting energy-saving equipment, and formulating subsidy policies. These measures can improve users' thermal comfort and reduce buildings' environmental impact. The selection of combinatorial optimization schemes that contain measures to guide and restrict users' behavior in addition to carrying out demand-side management can dynamically adjust energy consumption. At the same time, economic means should enable users to change their behavior and achieve a low-carbon life. Combination optimization and pricing incentives reduce building energy consumption and carbon emissions and reduce users' costs. thumb|Energy Consumption by Household Type in the United States North East in the year 2015.

Batteries are rated in terms of ampere-hours with their discharge rate and capacity set by the manufacturer at a specific current and total amount of time, as voltage differs with temperature and power will vary with rate of discharge. To fully convert a tiny home for living capacities off-grid, other power electronic power equipment is necessary, such as a charge controller, an inverter to power AC loads or down-regulators for DC loads, and proper protection devices such as circuit breakers and fuses. Specific sine inverters may offer simultaneous grid power hookup, called 'grid-tie inverters' in case of insufficient energy generation locally. Grid-tie inverters are of academic interest and are being studied by utilities for their impacts and potential benefits to voltage regulation, infrastructure implications, protection schema requirements, economics, and optimum policy regarding integration for implementation into the electrical grid with the rise of distributed generation, namely residential supplied solar power.thumb|Cabin-inspired tiny home built in the woods ===Size of homes=== Tiny homes range typically between . Considering the small size of tiny homes in comparison to that of average- sized homes, energy costs are invariably smaller; moreover, tiny home power grids are typically sourced from solar panels, which decreases the amount of publicly produced energy necessary to sustain the home. More importantly, the price difference of using solar power on a tiny home in comparison to an average-sized home, significantly decreases the homeowner expenses. The variation of energy emissions and cost necessary for output between a tiny home and average-sized home varies notably.

Such technology learns user-appliance activity patterns, gives a complete overview of various energy-consuming appliances, and can provide guidance to improve these patterns to contribute to energy conservation. As a result, they can strategically schedule appliances by monitoring the energy consumption profiles of the appliances, schedule devices to the energy-efficient mode, or plan to work during off-peak hours. Appliance-oriented approaches emphasize appliance profiling, curtailing, and scheduling to off-peak hours, as supervision of appliances is key to energy preservation. It usually leads to appliance curtailment in which an appliance is either scheduled to work another time or is turned off. Appliance curtailment involves appliance recognition, activity-appliances model, unattended appliance detection, and energy conservation service. The appliance recognition module detects active appliances to identify the activities of smart home users. After identifying users' activities, the association between the functional appliances and user activities is established. The unattended appliance detection module looks for active appliances but is unrelated to user activity. These functional appliances waste energy and can be turned off by providing recommendations to the user. Based on the smart home recommendations, users can give weight to certain appliances that increase user comfort and satisfaction while conserving energy. Energy consumption models of energy consumption of appliances and the level of comfort they create can balance priorities among smart home comfort levels and energy consumption. According to Kashimoto, Ogura, Yamamoto, Yasumoto, and Ito, the energy supply reduces based on the historical state of the appliance and increases according to the comfort level requirement of the user, leading to a targeted energy-saving ratio. Scenarios-based energy consumption can be employed as a strategy for energy conservation, with each scenario encompassing a specific set of rules for energy consumption. thumb|left|Elements of passive\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Deep energy retrofit\nContent: allowing owners to build up savings between phases.

It could also prove to be costlier. There's a lack of tools to execute over-time projects efficiently. ==== Strategies to increase success ==== Detailed planning must be inculcated from the very beginning. It is recommended to include post-occupancy evaluation at each stage of implementation to deal with modifications required in future stages. Home performance should be tracked at each stage either using utility bills or feedback devices. This helps in achieving the set-target for energy consumption.

The Home Energy Saver energy assessment tool allows consumers to conduct a do-it-yourself home energy audit and provides specific recommendations to help lower household energy consumption and utility costs. By entering a zip code, users get estimates for typical and efficient homes in their area. The estimates break down energy consumption by \"end use\". End uses reported by Home Energy Saver include: heating, cooling, water heating, major appliances, small appliances, and lighting. The more details a user enters, (e.g., insulation levels, roofing, age of major equipment, how systems are used) the more customized the assessment results and energy efficiency recommendations become. The tailored reports allows consumers to drill into estimated cost of improvements, anticipated payback time, projected utility bill savings, and how much energy use and green house gas production will be reduced. Consumers can vary the energy efficiency assumptions and the upgrade costs, (e.g., replacing the default values with actual estimates from contractors) and recalculate the payback times and other details. The Home Energy Saver website includes a section called LEARN which offers tips about energy savings, an explanation of the house-as-system energy efficiency approach, and other information to help people understand how energy is used in a home. When launched in 1994, Home Energy Saver was the first and only online home energy calculator. Thereafter, 6 million people have used it to analyze their home energy use.

They also specify high-performance windows and extra insulation in walls, ceilings, and floors. Another strategy, passive solar building design, is often implemented in low-energy homes. Designers orient windows and walls and place awnings, porches, and trees to shade windows and roofs during the summer while maximizing solar gain in the winter. In addition, effective window placement (daylighting) can provide more natural light and lessen the need for electric lighting during the day. Solar water heating further reduces energy costs. Onsite generation of renewable energy through solar power, wind power, hydro power, or biomass can significantly reduce the environmental impact of the building. Power generation is generally the most expensive feature to add to a building. Energy efficiency for green buildings can be evaluated from either numerical or non-numerical methods. These include use of simulation modelling, analytical or statistical tools. ===Water efficiency=== Reducing water consumption and protecting water quality are key objectives in sustainable building. One critical issue of water consumption is that in many areas, the demands on the supplying aquifer exceed its ability to replenish itself. To the maximum extent feasible, facilities should increase their dependence on water that is collected, used, purified, and reused on-site. The protection and conservation of water throughout the life of a building may be accomplished by designing for dual plumbing that recycles water in toilet flushing or by using water for washing of the cars. Waste-water may be minimized by utilizing water conserving fixtures such as ultra-low flush toilets and low-flow shower heads. Bidets help eliminate the use of toilet paper, reducing sewer traffic and increasing possibilities of re-using water on-site.

The earliest known written example, \"Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo\", appears in the original manuscript for Dmitri Borgmann's 1965 book Language on Vacation, though the chapter containing it was omitted from the published version. Borgmann recycled some of the material from this chapter, including the \"buffalo\" sentence, in his 1967 book, Beyond Language: Adventures in Word and Thought. In 1972, William J.

('I am a student, he is a driver.') ===Direct speech=== Quotes are not used to mark paragraphed direct quotation, which is instead separated out by the em-dash (--): -- Я Вас обожаю! -- сказал мишка лисе. 'I adore you!' said the bear to the fox. ===Quotation=== Inlined direct speech and other quotation is marked at the first level by guillemets «», and by lowered and raised reversed double quotes („“) at the second: Гончаров начинает «Фрегат „Паллада“» словами: «Меня удивляет». 'Goncharov begins his \"Frigate Pallada\" with the words: \"I am surprised.\"' Unlike American English, the period or other terminal punctuation is placed outside the quotation. As the example above demonstrates, the quotes are often used to mark the names of entities introduced with the generic word. ===Parenthetical expressions=== These are introduced with the international symbol of parentheses (). However, their use is typically restricted to pure asides, rather than, as in English, to mark apposition. ==Controversies== ===Spelling=== As in many languages, the spelling was formerly quite more phonemic and less consistent. However, the influence of the major grammarians, from Meletius Smotrytsky\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Klingon grammar\nContent: sentence, but time adverbs go before other adverbs.Okrand 1992, p.179 Adverbs can take the rover suffix `-Haʼ` to denote the opposite adverbial. ; `Doʼ` : fortunately ; `DoʼHaʼ` : unfortunately ==Conjunctions== Klingon has seven conjunctions, and they are different for nouns and for sentences. The noun conjunctions are `je` for a logical conjunction, `joq` for a logical disjunction and `ghap` for an exclusive disjunction. Noun conjunctions go after the nouns they connect. Sentence conjunctions are `ʼej` for a logical conjunction, `qoj` for a logical disjunction and `pagh` for an exclusive disjunction. `ʼach` (or `ʼa`) but is used to contrast sentences. == Clauses == === Relative clauses === In a relative clause, the verb has the type-9 verb suffix `-bogh` added to it.Okrand 1992, p.64 The order of the words in relative clauses remains the same as in regular clauses, but the head noun may optionally get the type-5 suffix `-ʼeʼ` added. Since there is already a type-5 noun suffix marking the head noun, nothing other than the subject or the object can be marked as head noun. Two sentences are formed instead to form the same idea. Relative clauses can have nouns with type 5 suffixes as modifiers, but it can be ambiguous as they can be misinterpreted as being part of the main sentence. === Purpose clauses === A purpose clause expresses the reason or goal of the action of the main clause. If it is modifying a noun it states the purpose of the noun. A purpose clause always goes before the clause or noun it modifies. This is the cause of some grammatical ambiguity in Klingon, as a `-meH` modifying a noun at the beginning of\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Hungarian verbs\nContent: or a negation, e.g. Nem írja le (\"He doesn't write it down\"). The inverted order is also used in the imperative, e.g. Írja le! (\"Write it down!\"). Finally, it may also refer to continuity, like Lement a lépcsőn (\"He went down the stairs\") vs. Ment le a lépcsőn (\"He was going down the stairs\"). If the verb with the particle is in the infinitive, the finite verb will be wedged between them, e.g. Le akarja írni (\"He wants to write it down\") or Le tudja írni (\"He can write it down\"). The particle may considerably affect the case of the complement: for example, the verb kezd (\"start something\") can take several different verb particles, all expressing the same concept (with minor differences), but their complement differs depending on the particle: *elkezd valamit (accusative) *nekikezd valaminek (dative) *belekezd valamibe (illative) *hozzákezd valamihez (allative) It happens because certain verb particles (the latter three among the examples) come from personal pronouns in the given case and they require agreement. When giving a short positive answer to a yes/no question, the particle can refer back to the whole sentence, see Yes/no questions. In literary style, articles can be reduplicated to indicate a gradual or stuttering action: ki-kijött a mὁkus (\"the squirrel crept out\"). ===Cases needing attention=== There are a few words which appear to begin with a particle, but don't actually, e.g. felel (\"reply\"), lehel (\"breathe/puff\"), kiált (\"give a shout\") and beszél (\"speak\") where fel-, le-, ki- and be- are parts of the words themselves, rather than actual particles. The difference is important in the above-mentioned syntactic cases when these elements will\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Language development\nContent: first make up names for agents and instruments that they don't know by a pattern (N-N), though some of them do not follow the pattern (*cutter grass for grass cutter). Then, they might have the right structure but the words are inappropriate since English already has words with the intended meaning such as car-smoke = exhaust. This process points to a preference for building words from other words, thus place less demand on memory than learning an entirely new word for each concept. ===Grammatical development=== Grammar describes the way sentences of a language are constructed, which includes both syntax and morphology. ====Syntactic development and morphological development==== Syntactic development involves the ways that various morphemes are ordered or combined in sentences. Morphemes, which are basic units of meaning in language, get added as children learn to produce simple sentences and become more precise speakers. Morphemes can be whole words (like \"happy\") or parts of words that change meaning of words (\" _un\"_ happy). Brown proposed a stage model that describes the various types of morphological structures that are developed in English and the age range within which they are normally acquired. Stage I: From 15–30 months, children start using telegraphic speech, which are two word combinations, for example 'wet diaper'. Brown (1973) observed that 75% of children's two-word utterances could be summarized in the existence of 11 semantic relations: *Attributive: 'Big house' *Agent-action: 'Daddy hit' *Action-object: 'Hit ball' *Agent-object: 'Daddy ball' *Nominative: 'That ball' *Demonstrative: 'There ball' *Recurrence: 'More ball' *Non-existence: 'All-gone ball' *Possessive: 'Daddy chair' *Entity + Locative: 'book table' *Action + Locative: 'go store' Stage II: At around 28–36 months, children begin to engage in the\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Sequence of tenses\nContent: verb is past or conditional: ::Batman said that he needs a special key for the Batmobile. This option is more likely to be used when the circumstance being expressed remains equally true now as it did when the speech act took place, and especially if the person reporting the words agrees that they are true or valid. Debate amongst grammarians over the appropriateness of the two types of sequence of tenses goes back as far as the 18th century. Use of the attracted sequence sometimes leads to additional problems when the grammatical construction of indirect speech includes an incorporated quotation – that is, when an attempt is made (though using indirect rather than direct speech) to report the words actually spoken. For example, if a minister spoke the words \"Such a policy is not without its drawbacks\", then a writer may attempt to report this as follows: :The minister admitted that \"such a policy is not without its drawbacks\". using quotation marks to denote that that portion of the sentence represents the minister's actual words. This, however, requires use of the natural sequence of tenses, which might not be felt appropriate in the given situation. There are various possible solutions to this problem: * Rearrange the sentence so that the incorporated quotations become set off, possibly as direct speech: ::The minister did not claim perfection: \"such a policy is not without its drawbacks\", he admitted. * Cut down the incorporated quotation to exclude the verb: ::The minister admitted that such a policy was \"not without its drawbacks\". * Use square brackets to indicate where the words deviate from those actually spoken: ::The minister admitted that \"such a policy [was] not without its drawbacks\". Similar problems arise from the other changes that typically occur in\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Cryptic crossword\nContent: arranged, assembled, assorted, at sea, awful, awkward, bad, barmy, becomes, blend, blow, break, brew, build, careless, changed, chaotic, characters, clumsy, composed, confused, contrived, convert, cooked, corrupt, could be, crazy, damaged, dancing, designed, develop, different, disorderly, disturbed, doctor, eccentric, edited, engineer, fabricate, fake, fancy, faulty, fiddled, fix, foolish, form, free, fudge, gives, ground, hammer, haywire, hybrid, improper, in a tizzy, involved, irregular, jostle, jumbled, jumping, kind of, knead, letters, loose, made, managed, maybe, messy, mistaken, mix, modified, moving, muddled, mutant, new, novel, odd, off, order, organised, otherwise, out, outrageous, peculiar, perhaps, playing, poor, possible, prepared, produced, queer, questionable, random, reform, remodel, repair, resort, rough, shaken, shifting, silly, sloppy, smashed, somehow, sort, spoilt, strange, style, switch, tangled, treated, tricky, troubled, turning, twist, unconventional, undone, unsettled, unsound, untidy, unusual, upset, used, vary, version, warped, wayward, weird, wild, working, wrecked, wrong.

Volume 41, Issue 1, January 2022, Pages 68–82 including the COVID-19 recession, the second largest global recession in recent history, decreased business in the services sector during the COVID-19 lockdowns, the 2020 stock market crash, which included the largest single-week stock market decline since the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the impact of COVID-19 on financial markets, the 2021–2022 global supply chain crisis, the 2021–2022 inflation surge, shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic including the 2020–present global chip shortage, panic buying, and price gouging. It led to governments providing an unprecedented amount of stimulus. The pandemic was also a factor in the 2021–2022 global energy crisis and 2022 food crises. Possible instability generated by an outbreak and associated behavioural changes could result in temporary food shortages, price spikes, and disruption to markets. Such price rises would be felt most by vulnerable populations who depend on markets for their food as well as those already depending on humanitarian assistance to maintain their livelihoods and food access. As observed in the 2007–2008 world food price crisis, the additional inflationary effect of protectionist policies through import tariffs and export bans could cause a significant increase in the number of people facing severe food insecurity worldwide. Many fashion, sport, and technology events have been canceled or have changed to be online. While the monetary impact on the travel and trade industry is yet to be estimated, it is likely to be in the billions and increasing.

On 19 June, the UN Secretary-General issued a new policy brief, the World of Work and COVID-19, concerning jobs, livelihoods and the well-being of workers, families and businesses globally, as they continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; with micro, small and medium enterprises in particular, suffering dire economic consequences. On 23 June, the Secretary-General on International Widow's Day called for countries to work towards dismantling laws that discriminate against women, particularly over inheritance, as they built back from the COVID-19 pandemic. On 25 June, the Secretary-General launched the 'UN Comprehensive Response to COVID-19' a major policy document to coordinate the United Nations System to \"save lives, protect societies, recover better\" during and after the pandemic. On 30 June, the Secretary- General called on the world to increase \"financial, humanitarian and political commitments\", to help end nearly a decade of major conflict and suffering in Syria, in a message to the fourth Brussels Donor Conference. ==== July ==== On 1 July 2020, the UN Secretary-General announced that unless the world acted immediately, with \"bold and creative\" solutions, the COVID-19 pandemic and related global recession would trigger \"years of depressed and disrupted economic growth\". On 2 July, the Secretary-General informed the Security Council that the COVID-19 pandemic was \"profoundly affecting\" global peace and security across the globe, and he urged it to employ its collective influence to mitigate the protections crisis facing millions of vulnerable people, including those affected by conflicts. On 6 July, the Secretary-General warned that the pandemic had exposed vulnerabilities to \"new and emerging forms of terrorism\", such as cyberattacks, bioterrorism and the misuse of digital\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Human rights issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic\nContent: text: The public health measures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic effectively contained and reduced the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on a global scale between the years 2020–2023, and had several other positive effects on the natural environment of planet Earth and human societies as well, including improved air quality and oxygen levels due to reduced air and water pollution, lower crime rates across the world, and less frequent violent crimes perpetrated by violent non-state actors, such as ISIS and other Islamic terrorist organizations. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that stay-at-home responses for slowing the pandemic, such as the quarantine mandates, should not be implemented at the expense of human rights. Broader concerns have been expressed about the effect of COVID-19 containment measures on human rights, democracy, and governance. Numerous experts report that various issues intersect, and are no longer an issue of only one category. ==Freedom of speech and expression== Based on a Freedom House report, at least 91 countries experienced restrictions on the news media as part of their response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with these restrictions occurring in 62% of ‘Partly Free countries’ and 67% of ‘Not Free countries.’ Furthermore, they also reported that additional government restrictions on free speech have been imposed in at least 72 countries. === Azerbaijan === Human Rights Watch reported that at least 6 activists and pro-opposition journalists have been detained following criticising the governments response to the pandemic, accusing them of abusing the restrictions to silence political opposition. === Bangladesh === The Government of Bangladesh has been accused of using the virus as a way to crack down on government critics.

The total number of article views itself was some 30 percent higher in mid-March 2020 compared to in mid-March 2019. An analysis of approximately 141,000 English language news headlines related to the Coronavirus from January 15, 2020, to June 3, 2020, uncovered that 52% of headlines evoked negative sentiments while only 30% evoked positive sentiments. The authors suggest that the headlines are contributing to fear and uncertainty which is having negative health and economic outcomes. Other studies in different contexts and focused in different media have found that news have not portrayed coping strategies and health behaviors as much as they could have. Other authors suggest that news coverage has resulted in the politicization of the pandemic, has been excessively concerned for the performance of political actors over the provision of scientific and self-efficacy information, and has been highly polarized. A November 2020 paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research titled \"Why Is All COVID-19 News Bad News?\" found that 91% of stories by major American media outlets about COVID-19 have a negative tone compared to 54% for major media outlets outside the United States and 65% for scientific journals. Issues with misinformation and fake news led to the development of CoVerifi, a platform that has the potential to help address the COVID-19 \"infodemic\". It has been claimed that the extended and prolonged coverage of the pandemic may have contributed to a COVID-19 information fatigue, making it more difficult to communicate updated information. Media experts say the challenge for some news outlets is accurately conveying the nuance of pandemic science to the public.

Numerous applications are in development, with different institutions and companies taking various approaches to privacy and data collection. Current efforts are aimed at gathering data. In a later stage, it is possible that sound apps will have the capacity (and ethical approvals) to provide information back to users. In order to develop and train signal analysis approaches, large datasets are required. ==History== The COVID-19 outbreak was announced as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 and has affected a growing number of people globally. In this context, advanced artificial intelligence techniques are being considered as tools in aiding our response to global health crisis. Other COVID-19 apps which offer solutions for user tracking have been developed. At the same time a number of approaches which tries to use respiratory sounds and artificial intelligence to understand if the disease can be diagnosed have been proposed. A few studies are available as preprints (i.e. not yet peer-reviewed) documents. ==Methodologies== The potential for using speech and sound analysis by artificial intelligence to help in this scenario, by surveying which types of related or contextually significant phenomena can be automatically assessed from speech or sound has been recently overviewed. These include the automatic recognition and monitoring of breathing, dry and wet coughing or sneezing sounds, speech under cold, eating behaviour, sleepiness, or pain. Additionally, the potential use-cases of intelligent speech analysis for COVID-19 diagnosed patients has also been presented. In particular, by analysing speech recordings from these patients, an audio-only-based model to automatically categorise the health state of patients from four aspects, including the severity of\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the environment\nContent: the COVID-19 pandemic made a catastrophic future seem less remote and action to prevent it more necessary and reasonable. However, it also had the opposite effect by putting the focus on more immediate issues of the pandemic rather than larger global issues, such as climate change and deforestation. The improvements caused by human inactivity during lockdowns were not an indication that climate change was improving long-term or that climate saving methods should be postponed. However, several international climate change conventions were postponed and, in some cases, not rescheduled. Notable examples were the postponement of the COP26, the United Nations Climate Change Conference, the World Conservation Congress, the Convention on Biological Diversity, and the U.N. Ocean Conference. These conferences were originally created so nations around the world could make concrete plans to ensure the safety of future generations. Though climate improvements seen during the lockdown provided hope for the future, as humans returned to normal activity, these changes proved to be temporary. == Impact on environmental monitoring and prediction == === Weather forecasts === The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) announced that a worldwide reduction in aircraft flights due to the pandemic could impact the accuracy of weather forecasts, citing commercial airlines' use of Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay (AMDAR) as an integral contribution to weather forecast accuracy. The ECMWF predicted that AMDAR coverage would decrease by 65% or more due to the drop in commercial flights. === Seismic noise reduction === Seismologists have reported that quarantine, lockdown, and other measures to mitigate COVID-19 have resulted in a mean global high-frequency seismic noise reduction of up to 50%.

The pandemic has led to severe global economic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies exacerbated by panic buying. Schools, universities and colleges have closed either on a nationwide or local basis in countries, affecting approximately percent of the world's student population. Many governments have restricted or advised against all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak. However, the virus is already spreading within communities in large parts of the world, with many not knowing where or how they were infected. The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching consequences beyond the spread of the disease and efforts to quarantine it. As the pandemic has spread around the globe, concerns have shifted from supply-side manufacturing issues to decreased business in the services sector. The pandemic is considered unanimously as a major factor in causing the recession. The pandemic has affected nearly every major industry negatively, was one of the main causes of the stock market crash and has resulted in major restrictions of social liberties and movement.\"ECR Risk Experts Contemplate another Financial Crisis\", Euromoney, 20 March 2020 Jeremy Weltman The COVID-19 crisis affected worldwide economic activity, resulting in a 7% drop in global commercial commerce in 2020.

Multiple governments introduced restrictions on websites to prevent reportage on the spread of misinformation and hide poor representations of themselves. The Chinese government attempted to control the global narrative on their initial unwillingness and inability to contain the initial outbreak by censoring millions of pieces of content containing over 2,000 keywords related to the pandemic on the leading communication platform WeChat and the live-streaming platform YY. In addition, nations such as Bangladesh and Egypt have blocked international news outlets from their respective Internet systems under the guise of spreading false information. This removal of the ability of media outlets to criticise governments represented a breach of freedom of expression under Article 19 of the UDHR. These restrictions allowed media outlets and journalists to be prosecuted and imprisoned more easily, often unfairly and arbitrarily. === Political discourse === Abulof, Le Penne and Pu analyzed public discourse through the NOW (News on the Web) corpus and Google Trends. Their findings indicate that 2020 saw a dramatic rise in thinking about ‘death’ and ‘mortality,’ worldwide. They also found that the words most associated with this morbidity since 2004 are ‘Covid’ and ‘coronavirus,’ and that similar trends appear in other languages. They argue that the rise is due to both the pandemic itself and pandemic politics – politicians fostering, using, and abusing, existential anxiety on a mass scale.

For a data set, it may be thought of as \"the middle\" value. The basic feature of the median in describing data compared to the mean (often simply described as the \"average\") is that it is not skewed by a small proportion of extremely large or small values, and therefore provides a better representation of the center. Median income, for example, may be a better way to describe center of the income distribution because increases in the largest incomes alone have no effect on median. For this reason, the median is of central importance in robust statistics. ==Finite data set of numbers== The median of a finite list of numbers is the \"middle\" number, when those numbers are listed in order from smallest to greatest. If the data set has an odd number of observations, the middle one is selected. For example, the following list of seven numbers, : 1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9 has the median of 6, which is the fourth value. If the data set has an even number of observations, there is no distinct middle value and the median is usually defined to be the arithmetic mean of the two middle values.Simon, Laura J.; \"Descriptive statistics\" , Statistical Education Resource Kit, Pennsylvania State Department of Statistics For example, this data set of 8 numbers : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 has a median value of 4.5, that is (4 + 5)/2. (In more technical terms, this interprets the median as\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Average\nContent: there is no mode. ===Median=== The median is the middle number of the group when they are ranked in order. (If there are an even number of numbers, the mean of the middle two is taken.) Thus to find the median, order the list according to its elements' magnitude and then repeatedly remove the pair consisting of the highest and lowest values until either one or two values are left. If exactly one value is left, it is the median; if two values, the median is the arithmetic mean of these two. This method takes the list 1, 7, 3, 13 and orders it to read 1, 3, 7, 13. Then the 1 and 13 are removed to obtain the list 3, 7. Since there are two elements in this remaining list, the median is their arithmetic mean, (3 + 7)/2 = 5. ===Mid-range=== The mid-range is the arithmetic mean of the highest and lowest values of a set. ==Summary of types== Name Equation or description As solution to optimization problem Arithmetic mean \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = \\frac{1}{n} (x_1 + \\cdots + x_n) \\underset{x \\in \\mathbb{R}}{\\operatorname{argmin}}\\, \\sum_{i=1}^n (x - x_i)^2 Median The middle value that separates the higher half from the lower half of the data set Geometric median A rotation invariant extension of the median for points in \\mathbb{R}^d \\underset{\\vec{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d}{\\operatorname{argmin}}\\, \\sum_{i=1}^n \\vec{x} - \\vec{x}_i _2 Tukey median Another rotation invariant extension of the median for points in \\mathbb{R}^d—a point that maximizes the Tukey depth \\underset{\\vec{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d}{\\operatorname{argmax}}\\, \\underset{\\vec{u} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d}{\\operatorname{min}} \\,\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Median\nContent: is split into 28% below the median and 5% above it so we subtract 5/33 of the interval width from the upper bound of 3.50 to give an interpolated median of 3.35.

Alternatively, if in an observed sample there are k scores above the median category, j scores in it and i scores below it then the interpolated median is given by : m_\\text{int} = m + \\frac{w}{2} \\left[\\frac{k - i} j\\right]. ===Pseudo-median=== For univariate distributions that are symmetric about one median, the Hodges–Lehmann estimator is a robust and highly efficient estimator of the population median; for non-symmetric distributions, the Hodges–Lehmann estimator is a robust and highly efficient estimator of the population pseudo-median, which is the median of a symmetrized distribution and which is close to the population median. The Hodges–Lehmann estimator has been generalized to multivariate distributions. ===Variants of regression=== The Theil–Sen estimator is a method for robust linear regression based on finding medians of slopes.. ===Median filter=== The median filter is an important tool of image processing, that can effectively remove any salt and pepper noise from grayscale images. ===Cluster analysis=== In cluster analysis, the k-medians clustering algorithm provides a way of defining clusters, in which the criterion of maximising the distance between cluster- means that is used in k-means clustering, is replaced by maximising the distance between cluster-medians. ===Median–median line=== This is a method of robust regression.

The lower weighted median is 2 with partition sums of 0.25 and 0.5, and the upper weighted median is 3 with partition sums of 0.5 and 0.25. These partitions each satisfy their respective special condition and the general condition. It is ideal to introduce a new pivot by taking the mean of the upper and lower weighted medians when they exist. With this, the set of numbers is \\\\{1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4\\\\} with each number having weights \\\\{0.25, 0.25, 0, 0.25, 0.25\\\\} respectively. This creates partitions that both sum to 0.5. It can easily be seen that the weighted median and median are the same for any size set with equal weights. Similarly, consider the set of numbers \\\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\\\} with each number having weights \\\\{0.49, 0.01, 0.25, 0.25\\\\} respectively. The lower weighted median is 2 with partition sums of 0.49 and 0.5, and the upper weighted median is 3 with partition sums of 0.5 and 0.25. In the case of working with integers or non-interval measures, the lower weighted median would be accepted since it is the lower weight of the pair and therefore keeps the partitions most equal. However, it is more ideal to take the mean of these weighted medians when it makes sense instead. Coincidentally, both the weighted median and median are equal to 2.5, but this will not always hold true for larger sets depending on the weight distribution. == Algorithm == The weighted median can be computed by sorting the set of numbers and finding the smallest set of numbers which sum to half the weight of the total weight.

In general, with this convention, the median can be defined as follows: For a data set x of n elements, ordered from smallest to greatest, : if n is odd, \\mathrm{median}(x) = x_{(n + 1)/ 2} : if n is even, \\mathrm{median}(x) = \\frac{x_{(n/2)} + x_{((n/2)+1)}}{2} Comparison of common averages of values [ 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 ] Type Description Example Result Midrange Midway point between the minimum and the maximum of a data set 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 5 Arithmetic mean Sum of values of a data set divided by number of values: \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i 4 Median Middle value separating the greater and lesser halves of a data set 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 3 Mode Most frequent value in a data set 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 2 ===Formal definition=== Formally, a median of a population is any value such that at least half of the population is less than or equal to the proposed median and at least half is greater than or equal to the proposed median. As seen above, medians may not be unique. If each set contains more than half the population, then some of the population is exactly equal to the unique median. The median is well-defined for any ordered (one- dimensional) data, and is independent of any distance metric. The median can thus be applied to classes which are ranked but not numerical (e.g. working out a median grade when students are graded from A to F), although the result might be halfway between classes\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Median\nContent: know the value of extreme results in order to calculate it. For example, in a psychology test investigating the time needed to solve a problem, if a small number of people failed to solve the problem at all in the given time a median can still be calculated. Because the median is simple to understand and easy to calculate, while also a robust approximation to the mean, the median is a popular summary statistic in descriptive statistics. In this context, there are several choices for a measure of variability: the range, the interquartile range, the mean absolute deviation, and the median absolute deviation. For practical purposes, different measures of location and dispersion are often compared on the basis of how well the corresponding population values can be estimated from a sample of data. The median, estimated using the sample median, has good properties in this regard. While it is not usually optimal if a given population distribution is assumed, its properties are always reasonably good. For example, a comparison of the efficiency of candidate estimators shows that the sample mean is more statistically efficient when—and only when— data is uncontaminated by data from heavy-tailed distributions or from mixtures of distributions. Even then, the median has a 64% efficiency compared to the minimum-variance mean (for large normal samples), which is to say the variance of the median will be ~50% greater than the variance of the mean. ==Probability distributions== thumb|100px|Geometric visualization of the mode, median and mean of an arbitrary probability density function For any real-valued probability distribution with cumulative distribution function F, a median is defined as any real number m that satisfies the inequalities \\int_{(-\\infty,m]} dF(x) \\geq \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ and } \\int_{[m,\\infty)} dF(x)\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Five-number summary\nContent: be computed from the five-number summary, including interquartile range, midhinge, range, mid-range, and trimean. The five-number summary is sometimes represented as in the following table: median median 1st quartile 3rd quartile Minimum Maximum ==Example== This example calculates the five-number summary for the following set of observations: 0, 0, 1, 2, 63, 61, 27, 13. These are the number of moons of each planet in the Solar System. It helps to put the observations in ascending order: 0, 0, 1, 2, 13, 27, 61, 63. There are eight observations, so the median is the mean of the two middle numbers, (2 + 13)/2 = 7.5. Splitting the observations either side of the median gives two groups of four observations. The median of the first group is the lower or first quartile, and is equal to (0 + 1)/2 = 0.5. The median of the second group is the upper or third quartile, and is equal to (27 + 61)/2 = 44. The smallest and largest observations are 0 and 63. So the five-number summary would be 0, 0.5, 7.5, 44, 63. ===Example in R=== It is possible to calculate the five-number summary in the R programming language using the `fivenum` function. The `summary` function, when applied to a vector, displays the five-number summary together with the mean (which is not itself a part of the five-number summary). The `fivenum` uses a different method to calculate percentiles than the `summary` function. ===Example in Python=== This python example uses the `percentile` function from the numerical library `numpy` and works in Python 2 and 3. import numpy as np def fivenum(data): \"\"\"Five-number summary.\"\"\" return np.percentile(data, [0, 25, 50, 75,\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Beta distribution\nContent: 0 ≤ α ≤ 5 and 0 ≤ β ≤ 5 thumb|(Mean–Median) for Beta distribution versus alpha and beta from 0 to 2 The median of the beta distribution is the unique real number x = I_{\\frac{1}{2}}^{[-1]}(\\alpha,\\beta) for which the regularized incomplete beta function I_x(\\alpha,\\beta) = \\tfrac{1}{2} .

People no longer needed an ISP account or be an expert with HTML to create web pages. With this new technology anyone could subscribe to the content of others. In the past 150 years there were two major means of communication: one to many, and one to one. Winer's software changed this. Today there is the addition of many to many or few to few. We use SMS for time sensitive alerts, text messages, and information. Publishing is easy with RSS. It allows the public to both blog about and keep up with current events, commentary, personals, and businesses. The internet makes the amateur the professional. There is no reliance on limited sources because the public can access information and receive events in real time. == Ch. 3: The Gates Come Down == The power of big Media’s ability to advertise and conceal news or information with the rest of the world is dwindling on the brink of a new era. This grassroots media era is what’s essentially in effect here. The power of the common people united in a “truth squad\" is at an all-time high. They are able to gather and release information through blogs, e-mails, and journals. The public can keep a watch on corporate offices and political affairs. In the past, big media had a controlled grip on what the public had access to. There are a number of ways for writers to get their story out others in their online communities.

An advantage of employing metaphors is that they permit individuals to visualize an abstract concept or phenomenon with which they have limited experience by comparing it with a concrete, well-understood concept such as physical movement through space. Metaphors to describe the Internet have been utilized since its creation and developed out of the need for the Internet to be understood by everyone when the goals and parameters of the Internet were still unclear. Metaphors helped to overcome the problems of the invisibility and intangibility of the Internet's infrastructure and to fill linguistic gaps where no literal expressions existed. \"Highways, webs, clouds, matrices, frontiers, railroads, tidal waves, libraries, shopping malls, and village squares are all examples of metaphors that have been used in discussions of the Internet.\" Over time these metaphors have become embedded in cultural communications, subconsciously shaping the cognitive frameworks and perceptions of users who guide the Internet's future development. Popular metaphors may also reflect the intentions of Internet designers or the views of government officials. Internet researchers tend to agree that popular metaphors should be re-examined often to determine if they accurately reflect the realities of the Internet, but many disagree on which metaphors are worth keeping and which ones should be left behind. ==Overview== Internet metaphors guide future action and perception of the Internet's capabilities on an individual and societal level. Internet metaphors are contestable and sometimes may present political, educational, and cognitive issues.Johnston, R. (2009). Salvation or destruction: Metaphors of the Internet.

Most traditional communication media, including telephone, radio, television, paper mail, and newspapers, are reshaped, redefined, or even bypassed by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as email, Internet telephone, Internet television, online music, digital newspapers, and video streaming websites. Newspaper, book, and other print publishing have adapted to website technology or have been reshaped into blogging, web feeds, and online news aggregators. The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interaction through instant messaging, Internet forums, and social networking services. Online shopping has grown exponentially for major retailers, small businesses, and entrepreneurs, as it enables firms to extend their \"brick and mortar\" presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely online. Business-to-business and financial services on the Internet affect supply chains across entire industries. The Internet has no single centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies. The overarching definitions of the two principal name spaces on the Internet, the Internet Protocol address (IP address) space and the Domain Name System (DNS), are directed by a maintainer organization, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols is an activity of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. In November 2006, the Internet was included on USA Todays list of the New Seven Wonders. == Terminology == The word internetted was used as early as 1849, meaning interconnected or interwoven. nineteenth-century use as an adjective.

The digitization that took place meant that everyday occurrences such as words, files, films, music, and pictures could be accessed and manipulated on a computer screen by all people across the world. # Workflow software: This is Friedman's catch-all for the standards and technologies that allowed work to flow. It is the ability of machines to talk to other machines with no humans involved. Friedman believes the first three forces have become a \"crude foundation of a whole new global platform for collaboration\". This is complemented by the emergence of software protocols (SMTP - simple mail transfer protocol, and HTML - the language that enabled anyone to design and publish documents that could be transmitted to and read on any computer anywhere). The emergence of such software is the \"Genesis moment of the flat world\" and means \"that people can work with other people on more stuff than ever before\". This created a global platform for multiple forms of collaboration, on which the next six flatteners depend. # Uploading: Uploading involves communities that upload and collaborate on online projects. Examples are open source software, blogs, and Wikipedia. Friedman considers the phenomenon \"the most disruptive force of all\" and also talks about how this gives individuals the possibility to replace news and the traditional music industry, because of individuals possibility of blogging and podcasting.

Thanks to efforts from Al Gore, the Internet grew beyond its military role when universities and commercial businesses were permitted to connect their networks to it. The main impetus for this was electronic mail, a far faster and convenient form of communication than a conventional letter and memo distribution, and the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). However, the Internet remained largely unknown to the general public, who were used to Bulletin Boards and services like Compuserve and America Online. This changed when Tim Berners-Lee devised a simpler form of Vannevar Bush's hypertext, which he dubbed the World Wide Web. \"The Web\" suddenly changed the Internet into a printing press beyond the geographic boundaries of physical countries; it was termed \"cyberspace\". Anyone with a computer and an Internet connection could write pages in the simple HTML format and publish their thoughts to the world. The Web's immense success also fueled the commercial use of the Internet. Convenient home shopping had been an element of \"visions of the future\" since the development of the telephone, but now the race was on to provide convenient, interactive consumerism. Companies trading through websites became known as \"dot coms\", due to the \".com\" suffix of commercial Internet addresses. The change of the century also lead to the fear and paranoia of Y2K, where it was hypothesized that the World's computers would glitch and cause havoc on banks, prisons, transit systems and more. === The world at the end of the century === By the end of the century, more technological advances and scientific discoveries been made than in all of preceding history.

The Internet continues to grow, driven by ever greater amounts of online information and knowledge, commerce, entertainment and social networking services. During the late 1990s, it was estimated that traffic on the public Internet grew by 100 percent per year, while the mean annual growth in the number of Internet users was thought to be between 20% and 50%. This growth is often attributed to the lack of central administration, which allows organic growth of the network, as well as the non-proprietary nature of the Internet protocols, which encourages vendor interoperability and prevents any one company from exerting too much control over the network. , the estimated total number of Internet users was 2.095 billion (30.2% of world population). It is estimated that in 1993 the Internet carried only 1% of the information flowing through two-way telecommunication. By 2000 this figure had grown to 51%, and by 2007 more than 97% of all telecommunicated information was carried over the Internet. Most traditional communication media, including telephony, radio, television, paper mail and newspapers are reshaped, redefined, or even bypassed by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as email, Internet telephony, Internet television, online music, digital newspapers, and video streaming websites.

It consists of millions of smaller domestic, academic, business and governmental networks, which together carry various information and services, such as email, online chat, file transfer, and the interlinked web pages and other documents of the World Wide Web. Contrary to some common usage, the Internet and the World Wide Web are not synonymous: the Internet is the system of interconnected computer networks, linked by copper wires, fibre-optic cables, wireless connections etc.; the Web is the contents, or the interconnected documents, linked by hyperlinks and URLs. The World Wide Web is accessible through the Internet, along with many other services including e-mail, file sharing and others described below. Toward the end of the 20th century, the advent of the World Wide Web marked the first era in which most individuals could have a means of exposure on a scale comparable to that of mass media. Anyone with a web site has the potential to address a global audience, although serving to high levels of web traffic is still relatively expensive. It is possible that the rise of peer-to-peer technologies may have begun the process of making the cost of bandwidth manageable. Although a vast amount of information, imagery, and commentary (i.e. \"content\") has been made available, it is often difficult to determine the authenticity and reliability of information contained in web pages (in many cases, self-published). The invention of the Internet has also allowed breaking news stories to reach around the globe within minutes. This rapid growth of instantaneous, decentralised communication is often deemed likely to change mass media and its relationship to society. \"Cross-media\" means the idea of distributing the same message through different media channels. A similar idea\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Internet\nContent: 1945 by the United States War Department in a radio operator's manual, and 1974 as the shorthand form of Internetwork. Today, the term Internet most commonly refers to the global system of interconnected computer networks, though it may also refer to any group of smaller networks. When it came into common use, most publications treated the word Internet as a capitalized proper noun; this has become less common. This reflects the tendency in English to capitalize new terms and move to lowercase as they become familiar. The word is sometimes still capitalized to distinguish the global internet from smaller networks, though many publications, including the AP Stylebook since 2016, recommend the lowercase form in every case. In 2016, the Oxford English Dictionary found that, based on a study of around 2.5 billion printed and online sources, \"Internet\" was capitalized in 54% of cases. The terms Internet and World Wide Web are often used interchangeably; it is common to speak of \"going on the Internet\" when using a web browser to view web pages. However, the World Wide Web or the Web is only one of a large number of Internet services, a collection of documents (web pages) and other web resources, linked by hyperlinks and URLs. == History == In the 1960s, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) funded research into time-sharing of computers. J. C. R. Licklider proposed the idea of a universal network while leading the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) at ARPA.

In some ways, this logo expresses the opposite intention from the recycle logo, in that the acid- free paper is intended to last indefinitely, rather than being recycled. Nevertheless, acid-free paper does not usually contain toxic materials (although certain inks do), so it is easily recycled or composted. A satirical version of the classic recycling logo also exists, in which the three arrows are twisted from a circular pattern to pointing radially outward, thus symbolizing wasteful one-time usage rather than environmentally friendly recycling. This message is reinforced by the circular inscription, \"THIS PROJECT WAS ENVIRONMENTALLY UNFRIENDLY\", surrounding the modified logo. The satirical logo appears in the 1998 catalog of an installation art work in Bayonne, New Jersey, in which the artist Steven Pippin modified a row of glass-doored washing machines in a laundromat to operate as giant cameras. The cameras were used to take sequential photographs in the manner of pioneering stop motion photographer Eadweard Muybridge. The front-loading washing machines were then used to develop and process the 24 inch (61 cm) diameter circular film negatives. ==See also== * Green Dot symbol * List of international common standards * Japanese recycling symbols ==References== ==Further reading== * Jones, Penny; Powell, Jerry. \"Gary Anderson has been found!\".

The symbol's creation originates on the first Earth Day in 1970, where the logo depicted is a Möbius strip. The public domain status of the symbol has been challenged before, but attempts have been unsuccessful. Many variations on the logo had been created since its creation. ==History== Worldwide attention to environmental issues led to the first Earth Day in 1970. Container Corporation of America, a large producer of recycled paperboard, sponsored a contest for art and design students at high schools and colleges across the country to raise awareness of environmental issues. It was won by Gary Anderson, then a 23-year-old college student at the University of Southern California, whose entry was the image now known as the universal recycling symbol. The symbol is not trademarked and is in the public domain. The public-domain status of the symbol has been challenged, but this challenge was unsuccessful owing to the wide use of the symbol. However, the universal symbol may have been inspired by similar existing at the time recycling symbols, such as one featuring two arrows chasing each other in a circle that Volkswagen stamped in the early 1960s into some automobile parts it remanufactured. ==Variants== The recycling symbol is in the public domain, and is not a trademark.

Types 1 and 2 are the most commonly recycled. == Cost–benefit analysis == Environmental effects of recyclingUnless otherwise indicated, this data is taken from , which attributes, \"Garbage Solutions: A Public Officials Guide to Recycling and Alternative Solid Waste Management Technologies, as cited in Energy Savings from Recycling, January/February 1989; and Worldwatch 76 Mining Urban Wastes: The Potential for Recycling, April 1987.\" Material Energy savings vs. new production Air pollution savings vs. new production Aluminium 95% 95% Cardboard 24% — Glass 5–30% 20% Paper 40% 73% Plastics 70% — Steel 60% — In addition to environmental impact, there is debate over whether recycling is economically efficient. According to a Natural Resources Defense Council study, waste collection and landfill disposal creates less than one job per 1,000 tons of waste material managed; in contrast, the collection, processing, and manufacturing of recycled materials creates 6–13 or more jobs per 1,000 tons. According to the U.S. Recycling Economic Informational Study, there are over 50,000 recycling establishments that have created over a million jobs in the US.

Similar and overlapping terms commonly used are closed-loop recycling, returnable packaging, reusable packaging, sustainable supply chains and circular economy. Laws have been passed in Maine and Oregon to make it the responsibility of producers of waste to pay into a fund based on the amount and the ability of the materials used in their packaging to be recycled. These funds will be employed to reimburse municipalities for eligible recycling and waste management costs, make investments in recycling infrastructure, and help citizens understand how to recycle. A circular economy is a large-scale model that involves the sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling of existing material in a global environment. Reverse logistics is an alternative to a traditional linear economy (take, make, waste). It seeks to reduce waste, recover resources at the end of a product's life, and channel it back into production, thus, significantly reducing pressure on the environment. Closed-loop box reuse shares similar goals and perspectives but is specific to the circular life cycle of fiberboard boxes in systems where reuse is the focus. == Environmental impact == The goal of closed-loop fiberboard box reuse is to reduce waste and pollution. The supply chain accounts for more than 90% of the environmental impact experienced by most consumer goods companies, more than 800 million tons of cardboard and paper are disposed of yearly in the USA. Reusing one ton of fiberboard boxes saves 390 kWh of energy, 46 gallons of oil and 700 gallons of water. Recycling (or reusing) that same ton of corrugated board produces less than 50% of sulfur-dioxide than if made from raw materials and saves more than 9 cubic yards of landfill.

Nonetheless, Pablo Gervás has developed a noteworthy system called ASPERA that employs a case- based reasoning (CBR) approach to generating poetic formulations of a given input text via a composition of poetic fragments that are retrieved from a case-base of existing poems. Each poem fragment in the ASPERA case-base is annotated with a prose string that expresses the meaning of the fragment, and this prose string is used as the retrieval key for each fragment. Metrical rules are then used to combine these fragments into a well-formed poetic structure. Racter is an example of such a software project. ==Musical creativity== Computational creativity in the music domain has focused both on the generation of musical scores for use by human musicians, and on the generation of music for performance by computers. The domain of generation has included classical music (with software that generates music in the style of Mozart and Bach) and jazz.

Corey F. O'Brien, \"November 9, 2008 sermon\" at North Prospect Union United Church of Christ in Medford. ==Background== Van Dyke wrote this poem in 1907 while staying at the home of Williams College president Harry Augustus Garfield. He was serving as a guest preacher at Williams at the time. He told his host that the local Berkshire Mountains had been his inspiration. The lyrics were first published in 1911 in Van Dyke's Book of Poems, Third Edition. Van Dyke wrote of this hymn: > These verses are simple expressions of common Christian feelings and desires > in this present time—hymns of today that may be sung together by people who > know the thought of the age, and are not afraid that any truth of science > will destroy religion, or any revolution on earth overthrow the kingdom of > heaven. Therefore this is a hymn of trust and joy and hope. \"This hymn is generally considered by hymnologists to be one of the most joyous expressions of hymn lyrics in the English language.\" It is also used as a Christian song for children.For example, it is song number 147 in Bobb, Barry All God's People Sing.

The poem describes how \"the press of hurried notes\" run repeating, changing, trilling and ringing, and bring to our inner being a song of mirth and light like a fountain piercing the \"shining tops of day\". The joyfulness, purity and unrestrained delight of the \"starry voice ascending\" awakens \"the best in us to him akin\". The lark's song is the wine which lifts us with him in the golden cup, the valley of this world: the lark the woods and brooks, the creatures and the human line, the dance and the marriage of life within it. The hearts of men shall feel them better, shall feel them celestially, \"as long as you crave nothing save the song\". The poet's voice becomes choric. The human voice (the song proceeds) cannot express so sweetly what is inmost. Unlike the skylark, Man has not such a \"song seraphically free/Of taint of personality\". In the lark's song, the human \"millions rejoice/For giving their one spirit voice\". Yet there are those revered human lives, made substantial by trials and in loving the earth, which though themselves unsinging yet come forth as a song worthy to greet heaven. It rises in that pure song into the highest heavens and is maintained there, so that our soul rises with theirs \"through self-forgetfulness divine\", filling the skies, showering the world \"from human stores\", soaring nearer towards silence. Consciously or unconsciously, Meredith's theme expands upon the sonnet False Poets and True by Thomas Hood (1799-1845), addressed to William Wordsworth,\"Sonnets. IV: False Poets and True\", in Poems by Thomas Hood, 2 vols (Edward Moxon, London 1846), II, p. 39 (Google). and is of course in debt to Shelley's Ode To\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Epithalamion (poem)\nContent: beyond an expression of celebratory, communal joy and into a more private, secret joy that remains ineffable. Finally, the poem moves toward affective joy, bestowing a kind of blessedness, or even grace, upon the listener, much like the practice of reciting the Psalms itself was supposed to do. Countering the relative absence of joy as a lived emotion, Spenser’s Epithalamion sets out to combine the discourses of joy—psalmic praises, hymnody, spiritual comfort, heavenly foretaste, festivity, matrimony, and finally, sex—into an all-inclusive articulation.\" Melissa Sanchez's essay praised the hidden messages in the poem, while James Larsen spoke of the poem in his critical edition: \"Epithalamion is a poem which gives ritualized and public affect to the personal on a number of levels, cosmographical, publicly prayerful and euchological.\" In 1929 British composer Edgar Bainton wrote his orchestral rhapsody Epithalamion, based on Spenser's poem. ==References== Category:Poetry by Edmund Spenser Category:1594 poems\n\nID: 6\nTitle: John Keats's 1819 odes\nContent: reasons.Bloom 1971, p.413 The poem describes the narrator's opinions on melancholy and is addressed specifically to the reader, unlike the narrative of many of the other odes. The lyric nature of the poem allows the poet to describe the onset of melancholy and then provides the reader with different methods of dealing with the emotions involved. Using personification, the poem creates characters out of Joy, Pleasure, Delight, and Beauty, and allows them to interact with two other characters which take the shape of a male and his female mistress mentioned (line 17). Keats himself fails to appear as a character in the poem, as there is no mention of the poet himself suffering from melancholy.Stewart 1990, p. 172 In the final stanza, the poet describes the mistress as dwelling in Beauty, but modifies the beauty by saying that it \"must die\" (line 21). Harold Bloom suggests that this provides the poem with a hint of Keats's philosophy of negative capability, as only the beauty that will die meets the poem's standard of true beauty. The image of the bursting of Joy's grape (line 28) gives the poem a theme of sexuality. According to critics, the bursting of the grape alludes to the passing from the moment of ultimate sexual pleasure to the decreased pleasure of a post-orgasmic state.McFarland 2000, pp. 94–6. ===Ode to a Nightingale=== thumb|Nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos) \"Ode to a Nightingale\" is the longest of the 1819 odes with 8 stanzas containing 10 lines each. The poem begins by describing the state of the poet, using negative statements to intensify the description of the poet's physical state such as \"numbless pains\" and \"not through envy of thy happy lot\" (lines 1–5). While the ode is written \"to\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Ode on Melancholy\nContent: of a negative relationship because it suggests that the only true beauty is one that will die. But Thomas McFarland, while acknowledging the importance of the original first stanza to Keats's endeavor, openly praises the removal of the lines as an act of what he calls \"compression\". McFarland believes that the poem's strength lies in its ability to avoid the \"Seemingly endless wordage of \"Endymion\" and lets the final stanza push the main themes on its own. By removing unnecessary information such as the reason the poet suggests the trip to Lethe, Keats allows the reader to avoid the \"fancy\" aspects that would have appeared in the first line and were not sustained throughout the rest of the text. == Sexual references == Although the poem contains no overt sexual references, allegations of a hidden sexuality in the poem's text appear in Christopher John Murray's Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era. Murray suggests that the poem instructs the reader to approach melancholy in a manner that will result in the most pleasurable outcome for the reader.Murray, Christopher John. Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era: 1760-1850 Taylor and Francis (2004). p. 723 The words \"burst Joy's Grape\" in line 28 lead Daniel Brass to state: > The height of the joy, the moment when the world can improve no further, is > both the end of joy and the beginning of melancholy.

For example, is an algebraic expression. Since taking the square root is the same as raising to the power , the following is also an algebraic expression: :\\sqrt{\\frac{1-x^2}{1+x^2}} An algebraic equation is an equation involving only algebraic expressions. By contrast, transcendental numbers like and are not algebraic, since they are not derived from integer constants and algebraic operations. Usually, is constructed as a geometric relationship, and the definition of requires an infinite number of algebraic operations. A rational expression is an expression that may be rewritten to a rational fraction by using the properties of the arithmetic operations (commutative properties and associative properties of addition and multiplication, distributive property and rules for the operations on the fractions). In other words, a rational expression is an expression which may be constructed from the variables and the constants by using only the four operations of arithmetic. Thus, :\\frac{3x - 2xy + c}{y-1} is a rational expression, whereas :\\sqrt{\\frac{1-x^2}{1+x^2}} is not. A rational equation is an equation in which two rational fractions (or rational expressions) of the form : \\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} are set equal to each other. These expressions obey the same rules as fractions. The equations can be solved by cross-multiplying. Division by zero is undefined, so that a solution causing formal division by zero is rejected. ==Terminology== Algebra has its own terminology to describe parts of an expression: 256px 1 – Exponent (power), 2 – coefficient, 3 – term, 4 – operator, 5 – constant,\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Algebraic equation\nContent: text: In mathematics, an algebraic equation or polynomial equation is an equation of the form :P = 0 where P is a polynomial with coefficients in some field, often the field of the rational numbers. For many authors, the term algebraic equation refers only to univariate equations, that is polynomial equations that involve only one variable. On the other hand, a polynomial equation may involve several variables. In the case of several variables (the multivariate case), the term polynomial equation is usually preferred to algebraic equation. For example, :x^5-3x+1=0 is an algebraic equation with integer coefficients and :y^4 + \\frac{xy}{2} - \\frac{x^3}{3} + xy^2 + y^2 + \\frac{1}{7} = 0 is a multivariate polynomial equation over the rationals. Some but not all polynomial equations with rational coefficients have a solution that is an algebraic expression that can be found using a finite number of operations that involve only those same types of coefficients (that is, can be solved algebraically). This can be done for all such equations of degree one, two, three, or four; but for degree five or more it can only be done for some equations, not all. A large amount of research has been devoted to compute efficiently accurate approximations of the real or complex solutions of a univariate algebraic equation (see Root-finding algorithm) and of the common solutions of several multivariate polynomial equations (see System of polynomial equations). ==Terminology== The term \"algebraic equation\" dates from the time when the main problem of algebra was to solve univariate polynomial equations. This problem was completely solved during the 19th century; see Fundamental theorem of algebra, Abel–Ruffini theorem and Galois theory. Since then, the scope of algebra has been dramatically enlarged. In particular, it\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Equation\nContent: special case of linear equations. When there is only one variable, polynomial equations have the form P(x) = 0, where P is a polynomial, and linear equations have the form ax + b = 0, where a and b are parameters. To solve equations from either family, one uses algorithmic or geometric techniques that originate from linear algebra or mathematical analysis. Algebra also studies Diophantine equations where the coefficients and solutions are integers. The techniques used are different and come from number theory. These equations are difficult in general; one often searches just to find the existence or absence of a solution, and, if they exist, to count the number of solutions. ===Polynomial equations=== In general, an algebraic equation or polynomial equation is an equation of the form :P = 0, or :P = Q where P and Q are polynomials with coefficients in some field (e.g., rational numbers, real numbers, complex numbers). An algebraic equation is univariate if it involves only one variable. On the other hand, a polynomial equation may involve several variables, in which case it is called multivariate (multiple variables, x, y, z, etc.). For example, :x^5-3x+1=0 is a univariate algebraic (polynomial) equation with integer coefficients and :y^4+\\frac{xy}{2}=\\frac{x^3}{3}-xy^2+y^2-\\frac{1}{7} is a multivariate polynomial equation over the rational numbers. Some polynomial equations with rational coefficients have a solution that is an algebraic expression, with a finite number of operations involving just those coefficients (i.e., can be solved algebraically). This can be done for all such equations of degree one, two, three, or four; but equations of degree five or more cannot always be solved in this way, as the Abel–Ruffini theorem demonstrates.

Popular methods are filtering with sand which only removes undissolved material, while chlorination and boiling kill harmful microbes. Distillation does all three functions. More advanced techniques exist, such as reverse osmosis. Desalination of abundant seawater is a more expensive solution used in coastal arid climates. The distribution of drinking water is done through municipal water systems, tanker delivery or as bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Reducing usage by using drinking (potable) water only for human consumption is another option. In some cities such as Hong Kong, seawater is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve freshwater resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter. Like other types of pollution, this does not enter standard accounting of market costs, being conceived as externalities for which the market cannot account. Thus other people pay the price of water pollution, while the private firms' profits are not redistributed to the local population, victims of this pollution. Pharmaceuticals consumed by humans often end up in the waterways and can have detrimental effects on aquatic life if they bioaccumulate and if they are not biodegradable. Municipal and industrial wastewater are typically treated at wastewater treatment plants. Mitigation of polluted surface runoff is addressed through a variety of prevention and treatment techniques. (See Surface runoff#Mitigation and treatment.) ====Industrial applications==== Many industrial processes rely on reactions using chemicals dissolved in water, suspension of solids in water slurries or using water to dissolve and extract substances, or to wash products or process equipment. Processes\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Water pollution\nContent: they are only part of the solution. Other important tools in pollution control include environmental education, economic instruments, market forces and stricter enforcements. Standards can be \"precise\" (for a defined quantifiable minimum or maximum value for a pollutant), or \"imprecise\" which would require the use of Best available technology (BAT) or Best practicable environmental option (BPEO). Market-based economic instruments for pollution control can include: charges, subsidies, deposit or refund schemes, the creation of a market in pollution credits, and enforcement incentives. Moving towards a holistic approach in chemical pollution control combines the following approaches: Integrated control measures, trans-boundary considerations, complementary and supplementary control measures, life-cycle considerations, the impacts of chemical mixtures. Control of water pollution requires appropriate infrastructure and management plans. The infrastructure may include wastewater treatment plants, for example sewage treatment plants and industrial wastewater treatment plants. Agricultural wastewater treatment for farms, and erosion control at construction sites can also help prevent water pollution. Effective control of urban runoff includes reducing speed and quantity of flow. Water pollution requires ongoing evaluation and revision of water resource policy at all levels (international down to individual aquifers and wells). === Sanitation and sewage treatment === thumb|Plastic waste on the big drainage, and air pollution in the far end of the drainage in Ghana Municipal wastewater can be treated by centralized sewage treatment plants, decentralized wastewater systems, nature-based solutionsUN-Water (2018) World Water Development Report 2018: Nature-based Solutions for Water, Geneva, Switzerland or in onsite sewage facilities and septic tanks.

This theory does not take into account persistent organic pollutants, which do not break down easily, and sometimes break down into more harmful constituents. Most industrialized nations have legislation in place to protect the public from impure drinking water. The Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 established maximum levels of pollutants in public drinking water, however its power to regulate private sources of bottled water or wells is severely limited. An additional issue regarding water pollution is the relative scarcity of clean fresh water on the earth, an issue which acutely presents itself in areas prone to drought. Agriculture uses a great deal of water, so much so that shortages in drought-prone areas can significantly affect crop yield. The main ethical issues with water pollution is whether growth should be restricted in order to preserve public health. An additional issue is the regulation of private corporations, whose activities may put populations of citizens at risk for groundwater contamination. Solid waste pollution includes pollutants like agricultural waste, construction waste, electronic waste, hazardous waste, medical, and mining waste. The two prevailing strategies for solid waste management are prevention and treatment/disposal. Waste prevention is the preferable, both economically and environmentally, as it does not necessitate costly removal and storage. Many of the same ethical issues related above manifest themselves with the handling and storage of solid waste, as well as an additional social justice issue of exactly where the storage area for solid waste should be located. ==Chemical regulation== Chemical regulation, including carbon particles and nanotubes and nanotechnology, are very new technologies whose long-term effects have not been satisfactorily studied.

Additionally, by replanting trees on the land after logging, it provides a structure for the soil to regain stability as well as replaces the logged environment. ===Marinas=== Installing shut off valves on fuel pumps at a marina dock can help reduce the amount of spillover into the water. Additionally, pump-out stations that are easily accessible to boaters in a marina can provide a clean place in which to dispose of sanitary waste without dumping it directly into the water. Finally, something as simple as having trash containers around a marina can prevent larger objects entering the water. == Country examples == === United States === Nonpoint source pollution is the leading cause of water pollution in the United States today, with polluted runoff from agriculture and hydromodification the primary sources. ==== Regulation of Nonpoint Source Pollution in the United States ==== The definition of a nonpoint source is addressed under the U.S. Clean Water Act as interpreted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The law does not provide for direct federal regulation of nonpoint sources, but state and local governments may do so pursuant to state laws. For example, many states have taken the steps to implement their own management programs for places such as their coastlines, all of which have to be approved by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the EPA. The goals of these programs and those alike are to create foundations that encourage statewide pollution reduction by growing and improving systems that already exist. Programs within these state and local governments look to best management practices (BMPs) in order to accomplish\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Water issues in developing countries\nContent: The WSP manual also includes three case studies drawn from WSP initiatives in three countries/regions. ===Alternative sources=== Utilizing wastewater from one process to be used in another process where lower-quality water is acceptable is one way to reduce the amount of wastewater pollution and simultaneously increase water supplies. Recycling and reuse techniques can include the reuse and treatment of wastewater from industrial plant wastewater or treated service water (from mining) for use in lower quality uses. Similarly, wastewater can be re-used in commercial buildings (e.g. in toilets) or for industrial applications (e.g. for industrial cooling). === Reducing water pollution === Despite the clear benefits of improving water sources (a WHO study showed a potential economic benefit of $3–34 USD for every US$1 invested), aid for water improvements have declined from 1998 to 2008 and generally is less than is needed to meet the MDG targets. In addition to increasing funding resources towards water quality, many development plans stress the importance of improving policy, market and governance structures to implement, monitor and enforce water quality improvements. Reducing the amount of pollution emitted from both point and non-point sources represents a direct method to address the source of water quality challenges. Pollution reduction represents a more direct and low-cost method to improve water quality, compared to costly and extensive wastewater treatment improvements. Various policy measures and infrastructure systems could help limit water pollution in developing countries. These include: # Improved management, enforcement and regulation for pre-treatment of industrial and agricultural waste, including charges for pollution # Policies to reduce agricultural run-off or subsidies to improve the quality and reduce the quantity needed of water polluting agricultural inputs (e.g. fertilizers) # Limiting water abstraction during critical low flow periods to limit the concentration of pollutants\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Urban runoff\nContent: Effective control of urban runoff involves reducing the velocity and flow of stormwater, as well as reducing pollutant discharges. Local governments use a variety of stormwater management techniques to reduce the effects of urban runoff. These techniques, called best management practices for water pollution (BMPs) in some countries, may focus on water quantity control, while others focus on improving water quality, and some perform both functions. Pollution prevention practices include low impact development (LID) or green infrastructure techniques - known as Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) in the UK, and Water-Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) in Australia and the Middle East - such as the installation of green roofs and improved chemical handling (e.g. management of motor fuels & oil, fertilizers, pesticides and roadway deicers). Runoff mitigation systems include infiltration basins, bioretention systems, constructed wetlands, retention basins, and similar devices.California Stormwater Quality Association. Menlo Park, CA. \"Stormwater Best Management Practice (BMP) Handbooks.\" 2003.New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. Trenton, NJ. \"New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual.\" April 2004. Providing effective urban runoff solutions often requires proper city programs that take into account the needs and differences of the community. Factors such as a city's mean temperature, precipitation levels, geographical location, and airborne pollutant levels can all affect rates of pollution in urban runoff and present unique challenges for management. Human factors such as urbanization rates, land use trends, and chosen building materials for impervious surfaces often exacerbate these issues. The implementation of citywide maintenance strategies such as street sweeping programs can also be an effective method in improving the quality of urban runoff. Street sweeping vacuums collect particles of dust and suspended solids often found in public parking lots and roads that often end up in runoff.

The same analysis found that the most important factors to tackle first include wood-burning heating systems and heavy traffic. Some of the proposed solutions to tackle air pollution problems include better public transport, using solar heating and pedestrianizing the city center. Additionally, nationwide gasification programs have been listed as the primary solution for the use of carbon and other pieces of furniture. ==Water pollution== As there was no existing information on the level of water pollution in 2021, the discharge of harmful and dangerous substances in water bodies without a permit is not prohibited with sanctions for illegal actions. This includes wastewater from industry and mining that gets released into the soil, sewage, watercourses, reservoirs and lakes. Wastewater in turn, gets generated from several sources, including industrial and mining wastewaters, wastewaters from households and wastewaters from agriculture. ==Public reactions and government initiatives== Many initiatives have been taken by the locals and the government to tackle and raise awareness about the issue of pollution. An AirCare application has been developed by an engineering student to monitor pollution levels and it gained widespread use by the wider public. Thousands of high school students protested on 20 December 2019 in front of the government building as part of global climate movements. The judiciary system in the country is responsible to take measures against air pollutants when there is enough evidence that pollution is harmful to health through central and local politics.\n\nID: 7\nTitle: World Water Day\nContent: for Advocacy? \". Oxfam Policy & Practice, Views & Voices, retrieved 20 March 2017 === 2018 – Nature for Water === The theme in 2018 explored how nature can be used to overcome the water challenges of the 21st century. This could be in the form of nature-based solutions to water- related challenges. For example, reducing floods, droughts, water pollution and protecting ecosystems could be solved using natural means, which nature uses, rather than man-made approaches. Restoring wetlands, implementing constructed wetlands, green roofs, green infrastructure, planting new forests, reconnecting rivers to floodplains, are some examples. Each of these use natural processes to rebalance the water cycle and improve human health and livelihoods.UN-Water (2018) World Water Development Report 2018: Nature-based Solutions for Water , Geneva, Switzerland === 2019 – Leaving No One Behind === The theme of 2019 was about tackling the water crisis by addressing the reasons why so many people are being left behind. Marginalized groups – women, children, refugees, indigenous peoples, disabled people – are often overlooked, and may face discrimination, as they try to access safe water. UN- Water asserts that \"water services must meet the needs of marginalized groups and their voices must be heard in decision-making processes\". === 2020 – Water and Climate Change === The theme of World Water Day 2020 was about water and climate change – and how the two are inextricably linked. UN-Water states that \"adapting to the water effects of climate change will protect health and save lives\". Also, using water more efficiently will reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

According to Aboriginal sources, marsupial moles may surface at any time of day, but seem to prefer to do so after rain and in the cooler season. Captive animals have been observed to feed above ground and then return underground to sleep. Occasionally it has been recorded to suddenly \"faint\" on the surface without waking up for several hours until disturbed. Above the ground it moves in a sinuous fashion, using its powerful forelimbs to haul the body over the surface and its hind limbs to push forward. The forelimbs are extended forward in unison with the opposite hind limb. Moles move about the surface with frantic haste but little speed, as one observer once likened it to a \"Volkswagen Beetle heaving its way through the sand\". ===Burrowing behavior=== While burrowing, the southern marsupial mole does not make permanent tunnels, but the sand caves in and tunnels back-fill as the animal moves along. For this reason its burrowing style has been compared to \"swimming through the sand”\". The only way its tunnels can be identified is as a small oval shape of loose sand. Although it spends most of its active time 20-100 cm below the surface, tunneling horizontally or at shallow angles, it sometimes for no apparent reason turns suddenly and burrows vertically to depths of up to 2.5 meters. Although most food sources are likely to occur at depths of approximately 50 cm from the surface, the temperature of these environments varies greatly from less than 15°C during winter to over 35°C during summer. While one of the captive moles was observed shivering when the temperature dropped under 16°C, it seems probable that moles can select the temperature of\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Northern broad-footed mole\nContent: As with most moles, it requires moist, friable soils, where it eats earthworms, insects, other invertebrates and some plant matter. Scapanus latimanus is a fossorial mammal, living below ground for most of its life. Only one animal occupies a burrow at a time and if a burrow has been vacated, it is often reoccupied within 2 days. Tunnels are typically dug far below surface level and the excess earth is removed via shafts that run laterally and vertically up to the surface. The excess earth pushed out of these shafts form distinct volcano-shaped mounds with the older earth towards the outer base and the newer earth towards the core. Shallow surface tunnels are sometimes dug and form a ridge in the soil on the surface. How often exactly these tunnels are used is unknown, as they are used irregularly. ==References== Category:Scapanus Category:Endemic mammals of the United States Category:Mammals described in 1842 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Taxa named by John Bachman\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Molehill\nContent: text: A molehill (or mole-hill, mole mound) is a conical mound of loose soil raised by small burrowing mammals, including moles, but also similar animals such as mole-rats, and voles. The word is first recorded in the first half of the 15th century. Formerly the hill was known as a 'wantitump', a word still in dialect use for centuries afterwards.Report and Transactions of the Devonshire Association (1875), Volume 7, p.564 The phrase \"making a mountain out of a molehill\" is commonly used metaphorically to mean \"to exaggerate a minor problem\". ==Evidence of burrows== Molehills are waste material which come from digging or repairing burrows, and so are usually found where the animal is establishing new burrows, or where existing ones are damaged (for example by the weight of grazing livestock). Where moles burrow beneath the roots of trees or shrubs, the roots support the tunnel, and molehills are less common, and so even a dense population of the animals may be inconspicuous in these places. Molehills are often the only sign to indicate the presence of the animal and recording their presence may be the most reliable way to determine the number of moles in an area. Commonly they occur in lines along the route of the burrow, but in some cases they may not be directly above the burrow itself but at the ends of short side-tunnels. The mole runs vary in depth from surface runs only a few inches deep, to main runs, some 12 to 18 inches deep The disturbance of the soil brings an important benefit by aerating and tilling it, adding to its fertility. Molehills are therefore sometimes used as a source of good soil for use in gardening and are particularly valued by some practitioners\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Talpidae\nContent: text: The family Talpidae () includes the moles (some of whom are called shrew moles and desmans) who are small insectivorous mammals of the order Eulipotyphla. Talpids are all digging animals to various degrees: moles are completely subterranean animals; shrew moles and shrew-like moles somewhat less so; and desmans, while basically aquatic, excavate dry sleeping chambers; whilst the quite unique star-nosed mole is equally adept in the water and underground. Talpids are found across the Northern Hemisphere of Eurasia and North America (although none are found in Ireland nor in the Americas south of northern Mexico), and range as far south as the montane regions of tropical Southeast Asia. The first talpids evolved from shrew-like animals which adapted to digging late in the Eocene in Europe.

However, it has also been claimed that \"the Naked Mole-Rat has a distinct temperature and activity rhythm that is not coupled to environmental conditions.\" The relationship between oxygen consumption and ambient temperature switches from a typical poikilothermic pattern to a homeothermic mode when temperature is at 29 °C or higher. At lower temperatures, naked mole-rats can use behavioral thermoregulation. For example, cold naked mole-rats huddle together or seek shallow parts of the burrows that are warmed by the sun. Conversely, when they get too hot, naked mole-rats retreat to the deeper, cooler parts of the burrows. ===Pain insensitivity=== thumb|right|Captive naked mole-rats huddling together The skin of naked mole-rats lacks neurotransmitters in their cutaneous sensory fibers. As a result, the naked mole-rats feel no pain when they are exposed to acid or capsaicin. When they are injected with substance P, a type of neurotransmitter, the pain signaling works as it does in other mammals but only with capsaicin and not with acids. This is proposed to be an adaptation to the animal living in high levels of carbon dioxide due to poorly ventilated living spaces which would cause acid to build up in their body tissues. Naked mole-rats' substance P deficiency has also been tied to their lack of the histamine-induced itching and scratching behavior typical of rodents. ===Resistance to cancer=== Naked mole-rats have a high resistance to tumours, although it is likely that they are not entirely immune to related disorders. A potential mechanism that averts cancer is an \"over-crowding\" gene, p16, which prevents cell division once individual cells come into contact (known as \"contact inhibition\").

Most moles dig permanent burrows, and subsist largely on prey that falls into them. The shrew moles dig burrows to access deep sleeping chambers, but forage for food on the forest floor by night. Desmans dig burrows in riverbanks for shelter and forage in the water of rivers and lakes. The star-nosed mole is able to make a living much as other moles do, but are also very capable aquatic creatures, where they are able to smell underwater by using their unique proboscis to hold out a bubble of air into the water. Talpids appear to be generally quite antisocial animals, and although at least one species, the star-nosed mole, will share burrows, talpids are known to engage in much territorial behavior, including extraordinarily fast battles. ==Classification== The family is divided into three subfamilies, 19 genera and 59 species. *Family Talpidae **Subfamily Uropsilinae - Asian shrew-like moles (Chinese shrew moles) *** Genus Uropsilus - eight species in China, Bhutan, and Myanmar ****Equivalent-teeth shrew mole, U. aequodonenia ****Anderson's shrew mole, U. andersoni **** Black-backed shrew mole, U. atronates ****Dabie Mountains shrew mole, U. dabieshanensis ****Gracile shrew mole, U. gracilis ****Inquisitive shrew mole, U. investigator **** Snow Mountain shrew mole, U. nivatus ****Chinese shrew mole, U. soricipes **Subfamily Scalopinae - New World moles *** Tribe Condylurini - condylurine moles **** Genus Condylura - one species in eastern North America *****Star-nosed mole, C. cristata *** Tribe Scalopini - scalopine moles\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Naked mole-rat\nContent: inhibition\"). The cells of most mammals, including naked mole-rats, undergo contact inhibition via the gene p27 which prevents cellular reproduction at a much higher cell density than p16 does. The combination of p16 and p27 in naked mole-rat cells is a double barrier to uncontrolled cell proliferation, one of the hallmarks of cancer. In 2013, scientists reported that the reason naked mole-rats do not get cancer can be attributed to an \"extremely high-molecular-mass hyaluronan\" (HMW-HA) (a natural sugary substance), which is over \"five times larger\" than that in cancer-prone humans and cancer-susceptible laboratory animals. The scientific report was published a month later as the cover story of the journal Nature. A few months later, the same University of Rochester research team announced that naked mole-rats have ribosomes that produce extremely error-free proteins. Because of both of these discoveries, the journal Science named the naked mole-rat \"Vertebrate of the Year\" for 2013. In 2016, a report was published that recorded the first ever discovered malignancies in two naked mole-rats, in two individuals. However, both naked mole-rats were captive-born at zoos, and hence lived in an environment with 21% atmospheric oxygen compared to their natural 2–9%, which may have promoted tumorigenesis. The Golan Heights blind mole-rat (Spalax golani) and the Judean Mountains blind mole-rat (Spalax judaei) are also resistant to cancer, but by a different mechanism. ===Longevity=== The naked mole-rat is also of interest because it is extraordinarily long-lived for a rodent of its size (up to 32 years) and holds the record for the longest-living rodent. The mortality rate of the species does not increase with age, and thus does not conform to that of most mammals (as frequently defined by the\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Subterranean fauna\nContent: text: Subterranean fauna refers to animal species that are adapted to live in an underground environment. Troglofauna and stygofauna are the two types of subterranean fauna. Both are associated with hypogean habitats – troglofauna is associated with terrestrial subterranean environment (caves and underground spaces above the water table), and stygofauna with all kind of subterranean waters (groundwater, aquifers, subterranean rivers, dripping bowls, gours, etc.). ==Environment== Subterranean fauna is found worldwide and includes representatives of many animal groups, mostly arthropods and other invertebrates. However, there is a number of vertebrates (such as cavefishes and cave salamanders), although they are less common. Because of the complexity in exploring underground environments, many subterranean species are yet to be discovered and described. Peculiarities of underground habitat make it an extreme environment and, consequently, underground species are usually less than species living in epigean habitats. The main characteristic of underground environment is the lack of sunlight. Climatic values, like temperature and relative humidity, are generally almost stable – temperature corresponds to annual mean temperature in the place where the cavity opens, relative humidity rarely drops below 90%. Food sources are limited and localized. The lack of sunlight inhibits photosynthetic processes, so food comes only from epigean environment (through percolating water, gravity, or passive transport by animals). An exception are caves like the Movile Cave, where chemosynthesis forms the foundation of the food chain. Caves that are close to the surface, such as lava tubes, often have tree roots hanging from the cave roof, which provide nutrients for sap-feeding insects.The weird creatures inhabiting the lava tubes of HawaiiIdentifying tree roots in the caves of Quintana Roo, Mexico as a step toward ecological insights and improved conservation Other important food sources in underground\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Explain why the given definition is wrong: 'A mole is an animal that lives underground.'\n\n[/INST]IDs: 5, 3</s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

It is taught to students who are presumed to have no knowledge of mathematics beyond the basic principles of arithmetic. In arithmetic, only numbers and their arithmetical operations (such as +, −, ×, ÷) occur. In algebra, numbers are often represented by symbols called variables (such as a, n, x, y or z). This is useful because: * It allows the general formulation of arithmetical laws (such as a + b = b + a for all a and b), and thus is the first step to a systematic exploration of the properties of the real number system. * It allows the reference to \"unknown\" numbers, the formulation of equations and the study of how to solve these. (For instance, \"Find a number x such that 3x + 1 = 10\" or going a bit further \"Find a number x such that ax + b = c\". This step leads to the conclusion that it is not the nature of the specific numbers that allow us to solve it, but that of the operations involved.) * It allows the formulation of functional relationships. (For instance, \"If you sell x tickets, then your profit will be 3x − 10 dollars, or f(x) = 3x − 10, where f is the function, and x is the number to which the function is applied\".) === Polynomials === A polynomial is an expression that is the sum of a finite number of non-zero terms, each term consisting of the product of a constant and a finite number of variables raised to whole number powers.

This is also the case for the expressions representing real numbers, which are built from the integers by using the arithmetical operations, the logarithm and the exponential (Richardson's theorem). ==Variables== Many mathematical expressions include variables. Any variable can be classified as being either a free variable or a bound variable. For a given combination of values for the free variables, an expression may be evaluated, although for some combinations of values of the free variables, the value of the expression may be undefined. Thus an expression represents a function whose inputs are the values assigned to the free variables and whose output is the resulting value of the expression. For example, the expression : x/y evaluated for x = 10, y = 5, will give 2; but it is undefined for y = 0. The evaluation of an expression is dependent on the definition of the mathematical operators and on the system of values that is its context. Two expressions are said to be equivalent if, for each combination of values for the free variables, they have the same output, i.e., they represent the same function. Example: The expression :\\sum_{n=1}^{3} (2nx) has free variable x, bound variable n, constants 1, 2, and 3, two occurrences of an implicit multiplication operator, and a summation operator. The expression is equivalent to the simpler expression 12x.

For simplicity, in this article a real- valued function of a real variable will be simply called a function. To avoid any ambiguity, the other types of functions that may occur will be explicitly specified. Some functions are defined for all real values of the variables (one says that they are everywhere defined), but some other functions are defined only if the value of the variable is taken in a subset X of ℝ, the domain of the function, which is always supposed to contain an interval of positive length. In other words, a real-valued function of a real variable is a function :f: X \\to \\R such that its domain X is a subset of ℝ that contains an interval of positive length. A simple example of a function in one variable could be: : f : X \\to \\R : X = \\\\{ x \\in \\R \\,:\\, x \\geq 0\\\\} : f(x) = \\sqrt{x} which is the square root of x. ===Image=== The image of a function f(x) is the set of all values of when the variable x runs in the whole domain of . For a continuous (see below for a definition) real-valued function with a connected domain, the image is either an interval or a single value. In the latter case, the function is a constant function.

In simple linear regression, the model : y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\varepsilon, \\, is used, where ε is an unobserved random error with mean zero conditioned on a scalar variable x. In this model, for each unit increase in the value of x, the conditional expectation of y increases by β1 units. In many settings, such a linear relationship may not hold. For example, if we are modeling the yield of a chemical synthesis in terms of the temperature at which the synthesis takes place, we may find that the yield improves by increasing amounts for each unit increase in temperature. In this case, we might propose a quadratic model of the form : y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x + \\beta_2 x^2 + \\varepsilon. \\, In this model, when the temperature is increased from x to x + 1 units, the expected yield changes by \\beta_1+\\beta_2(2x+ 1). (This can be seen by replacing x in this equation with x+1 and subtracting the equation in x from the equation in x+1.) For infinitesimal changes in x, the effect on y is given by the total derivative with respect to x: \\beta_1+2\\beta_2x. The fact that the change in yield depends on x is what makes the relationship between x and y nonlinear even though the model is linear in the parameters to be estimated. In general, we can model the expected value of y as an nth degree polynomial, yielding the general polynomial regression model : y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x^2 + \\beta_3 x^3 + \\cdots + \\beta_n x^n + \\varepsilon. \\, Conveniently, these models are all linear from the point of view of\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Equality (mathematics)\nContent: specified or depend on some variables, equality is a proposition, which may be true for some values and false for other values. Equality is a binary relation (i.e., a two-argument predicate) which may produce a truth value (false or true) from its arguments. In computer programming, its computation from the two expressions is known as comparison. == Identities== When A and B may be viewed as functions of some variables, then A = B means that A and B define the same function. Such an equality of functions is sometimes called an identity. An example is \\left(x + 1\\right)\\left(x + 1\\right) = x^2 + 2 x + 1. Sometimes, but not always, an identity is written with a triple bar: \\left(x + 1\\right)\\left(x + 1\\right) \\equiv x^2 + 2 x + 1. ==Equations== An equation is a problem of finding values of some variables, called , for which the specified equality is true. The term \"equation\" may also refer to an equality relation that is satisfied only for the values of the variables that one is interested in. For example, x^2 + y^2 = 1 is the of the unit circle. There is no standard notation that distinguishes an equation from an identity, or other use of the equality relation: one has to guess an appropriate interpretation from the semantics of expressions and the context. An identity is to be true for all values of variables in a given domain. An \"equation\" may sometimes mean an identity, but more often than not, it a subset of the variable space to be the subset where the equation is true. == Approximate equality == There are some logic systems that do not have any notion of equality.

Enlightening communities on the socioeconomic implications of fossil fuel use is a potent mode of rhetoric that can promote the implementation of renewable energy sources. Transparent local planning also proves useful in public discourse when used to determine the location of wind farms in communities supporting renewable energy. According to an article by John Barry et al., a crucial factor communities need to engage discourse on is the principle of \"assumption of and imperative towards consensus.\" This principle claims that a community cannot neglect its energy or climate change responsibilities, and that it must do its part in helping to decrease carbon emissions through renewable energy reformation. Hence, communities that continually engage in mutual learning and discourse by conflict resolution will help progress renewable energy. == Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy == Legislative definitions of renewable energy, used when determining energy projects eligible for subsidies or tax breaks, usually exclude conventional nuclear reactor designs. Physicist Bernard Cohen elucidated in 1983 that uranium dissolved in seawater, when used in Breeder reactors (which are reactors that \"breed\" more fissile nuclear fuel than they consume from base fertile material) is effectively inexhaustible, with the seawater bearing uranium constantly replenished by river erosion carrying more uranium into the sea, and could therefore be considered a renewable source of energy. In 1987, the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED), an organization independent from, but created by, the United Nations, published Our Common Future, in which breeder reactors, and, when it is developed, fusion power are both classified within the same category as conventional renewable energy sources, such as solar and falling water. == See also ==\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Copper in renewable energy\nContent: text: Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, tidal, hydro, biomass, and geothermal have become significant sectors of the energy market.IEA (2022), Renewables 2022, IEA, Paris https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2022, License: CC BY 4.0Global trends in renewable energy investment 2012, by REN21 (Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century); http://www.ren21.net/gsr The rapid growth of these sources in the 21st century has been prompted by increasing costs of fossil fuels as well as their environmental impact issues that significantly lowered their use.

According to a review of the 181 peer-reviewed papers on 100% renewable energy which were published until 2018, \"[t]he great majority of all publications highlights the technical feasibility and economic viability of 100% RE systems.\" While there are still many publications which focus on electricity only, there is a growing number of papers that cover different energy sectors and sector-coupled, integrated energy systems. This cross- sectoral, holistic approach is seen as an important feature of 100% renewable energy systems and is based on the assumption \"that the best solutions can be found only if one focuses on the synergies between the sectors\" of the energy system such as electricity, heat, transport or industry. Stephen W. Pacala and Robert H. Socolow of Princeton University have developed a series of \"climate stabilization wedges\" that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change, and \"renewable energy sources\", in aggregate, constitute the largest number of their \"wedges\". Similarly, in the United States, the independent National Research Council has noted that \"sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change, energy security, and the escalation of energy costs ... Renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the United States, taken collectively, can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand.\" The main barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low-carbon energy strategies are political rather than technological. According to the 2013 Post Carbon Pathways report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are: climate change denial, the fossil fuels lobby, political inaction, unsustainable energy consumption, outdated\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Renewable energy\nContent: Renewable energy resources and significant opportunities for energy efficiency exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries. Rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency, and technological diversification of energy sources, would result in significant energy security and economic benefits. Solar and wind power have got much cheaper. In some cases it will be cheaper to transition to these sources as opposed to continuing to use the current, inefficient, fossil fuels. In addition, electrification with renewable energy is more efficient and therefore leads to significant reductions in primary energy requirements.Volker Quaschning, Regenerative Energiesysteme. Technologie – Berechnung – Simulation. 8th. Edition. Hanser (Munich) 2013, p. 49.It would also reduce environmental pollution such as air pollution caused by the burning of fossil fuels, and improve public health, reduce premature mortalities due to pollution and save associated health costs that could amount to trillions of dollars annually. Multiple analyses of decarbonization strategies have found that quantified health benefits can significantly offset the costs of implementing these strategies. Climate change concerns, coupled with the continuing fall in the costs of some renewable energy equipment, such as wind turbines and solar panels, are driving increased use of renewables. New government spending, regulation and policies helped the industry weather the global financial crisis better than many other sectors.Clean Edge (2009). Clean Energy Trends 2009 pp. 1–4. , however, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency, renewables overall share in the energy mix (including power, heat and transport) needs to grow six times faster, in order to keep the rise in average global temperatures \"well below\" during the present century, compared to pre-industrial levels. === Scale === A household's solar panels, and batteries if\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation\nContent: text: The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a special report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (SRREN) on May 9, 2011. The report developed under the leadership of Ottmar Edenhofer evaluates the global potential for using renewable energy to mitigate climate change. This IPCC special report provides broader coverage of renewable energy than was included in the IPCC's 2007 climate change assessment report, as well as stronger renewable energy policy coverage. In the present time, there is an obvious trend to have more renewable energy sources and therefore to overcome life crisis that can go when oil and gas expire. Renewable energy can contribute to \"social and economic development, energy access, secure energy supply, climate change mitigation, and the reduction of negative environmental and health impacts\". Under favourable circumstances, cost savings in comparison to non-renewable energy use exist. == History == Previously the IPCC examined both renewable energy and energy efficiency in its fourth assessment report, published in 2007, but members decided that renewable energy commercialization merits additional in-depth coverage because of its importance in reducing carbon emissions. The outline of the IPCC WG III's Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (SRREN) was approved at the IPCC Plenary in Budapest in April, 2008. The final report was approved at the 11th session of the IPCC Working Group III, May 2011, in Abu Dhabi. The SRREN addresses the information needs of policy makers, private sector and civil society in a comprehensive way and will provide valuable information for further IPCC publications, including the upcoming IPCC 5th Assessment Report. The SRREN was released for publication on May 9, 2011.Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation The Special Report \"aims to\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Renewable energy in developing countries\nContent: 2.5 million women and young children in developing countries die prematurely each year from breathing the fumes from indoor biomass stoves\". Renewable energy can improve this situation by reducing exposure to indoor pollutants. Furthermore, renewable can also provide energy to refrigerate medicine and sterilize medical equipment in rural areas where the access to electricity is difficult. It can also provide power to supply the fresh water and sewerage services needed to reduce the spread of infectious diseases. ==Government policies== More developing countries are implementing the public policies needed for the widespread development of renewable energy technologies and markets, which have traditionally been dominated by Europe, Japan, and North America. The exceptions include countries like Brazil, which has built the world’s leading biofuels industry, China, India, which are leaders in developing decentralized renewable sources such as small hydro, small wind, biogas, and solar water heating. However, policies like feed-in tariff are applied. Besides, with the Kyoto Protocol, the program called the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) that allows for industrialized nations to invest in projects that reduce emissions in developing countries as an alternative to more expensive emission reductions in their own countries.Adaptation Fund Developing-country Governments need to steer resources mobilized for large- scale investments into new production sectors and new technologies. Some argue that policies should base on active industrial policies, combining large scale investments and active policy interventions. There is a need of subsidizing these type of energy services to make them affordable to the major part of the population. ===Asia=== ==== China ==== ==== India ==== ==== Pakistan ==== ==== Philippines ==== The Philippine government sees the growth of the renewable energy sector essential for national energy security.

The plan must justify energy demand and supply and assess the actual costs and benefits to the local, regional, and global environments. Responsible energy use is fundamental to sustainable development and a sustainable future. Energy management must balance justifiable energy demand with appropriate energy supply. The process couples energy awareness, energy conservation, and energy efficiency with the use of primary renewable energy resources.Various. \"Guiding Principles of Sustainable Design\".

In the report, the IPCC said \"as infrastructure and energy systems develop, in spite of the complexities, there are few, if any, fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet a majority share of total energy demand in locations where suitable renewable resources exist or can be supplied\". Under favourable circumstances, cost savings in comparison to non-renewable energy use exist. IPCC scenarios \"generally indicate that growth in renewable energy will be widespread around the world\". The IPCC said that if governments were supportive, and the full range of renewable technologies were deployed, renewable energy could account for almost 80% of the world's energy supply within four decades. Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the IPCC, said the necessary investment in renewables would cost only about 1% of global GDP annually. This approach could keep greenhouse gas concentrations to less than 450 parts per million, the safe level beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible. == See also == * IPCC 4th Assessment Report (AR4) * IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) * IPCC Summary for Policymakers * IRENA * Renewable energy commercialization * REN21 * List of books about renewable energy ==References== ==External links== *Report (in\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Write a short paragraph about the given topic 'The importance of using renewable energy'\n\n[/INST]IDs: 4, 3, 2</s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

Machine learning is a core part of AI, allowing software to more accurately predict outcomes without explicitly being programmed. It is also possible to combine artificial intelligence with edge computing in order to provide industrial edge intelligence solutions. F. Foukalas and A. Tziouvaras, \"Edge Artificial Intelligence for Industrial Internet of Things Applications: An Industrial Edge Intelligence Solution\" ===Architecture=== IIoT systems are usually conceived as a layered modular architecture of digital technology. The device layer refers to the physical components: CPS, sensors or machines. The network layer consists of physical network buses, cloud computing and communication protocols that aggregate and transport the data to the service layer, which consists of applications that manipulate and combine data into information that can be displayed on the driver dashboard. The top-most stratum of the stack is the content layer or the user interface.

Turing published \"Computing machinery and intelligence\" in Mind, in which he proposed that machines could be tested for intelligence using questions and answers. This process is now named the Turing Test. The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) was first used by John McCarthy who considered it to mean \"the science and engineering of making intelligent machines\".What is Artificial Intelligence? by John McCarthy Stanford University It can also refer to intelligence as exhibited by an artificial (man-made, non-natural, manufactured) entity. AI is studied in overlapping fields of computer science, psychology, neuroscience and engineering, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation and usually developed using customized machines or computers. Research in AI is concerned with producing machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior. Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer diagnostic and consumer questions, handwriting, natural language, speech and facial recognition. As such, the study of AI has also become an engineering discipline, focused on providing solutions to real life problems, knowledge mining, software applications, strategy games like computer chess and other video games. One of the biggest limitations of AI is in the domain of actual machine comprehension. Consequentially natural-language understanding and connectionism (where behavior of neural networks is investigated) are areas of active research and development. The debate about the nature of the mind is relevant to the development of artificial intelligence. If the mind is indeed a thing separate from or higher than the functioning of the brain, then hypothetically it would be much more difficult to recreate within a machine, if it were possible at all. If, on the other hand, the mind is no more than the aggregated functions of the brain,\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Intelligent agent\nContent: Intelligent agents are also closely related to software agents (an autonomous computer program that carries out tasks on behalf of users). == As a definition of artificial intelligence == Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach defines an \"agent\" as > Anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors > and acting upon that environment through actuators, defines a \"rational agent\" as: > An agent that acts so as to maximize the expected value of a performance > measure based on past experience and knowledge. and defines the field of \"artificial intelligence\" research as: > The study and design of rational agents Padgham & Winikoff (2005) agree that an intelligent agent is situated in an environment and responds in a timely (though not necessarily real-time) manner to environment changes. However, intelligent agents must also proactively pursue goals in a flexible and robust way. Optional desiderata include that the agent be rational, and that the agent be capable of belief-desire- intention analysis.Lin Padgham and Michael Winikoff. Developing intelligent agent systems: A practical guide. Vol. 13. John Wiley & Sons, 2005. Kaplan and Haenlein define artificial intelligence as \"A system's ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation.\" This definition is closely related to that of an intelligent agent. === Advantages === Philosophically, this definition of artificial intelligence avoids several lines of criticism. Unlike the Turing test, it does not refer to human intelligence in any way. Thus, there is no need to discuss if it is \"real\" vs \"simulated\" intelligence (i.e., \"synthetic\" vs \"artificial\" intelligence) and does not indicate that such a machine has a mind, consciousness or true understanding (i.e.,\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Artificial intelligence in fiction\nContent: text: Artificial intelligence is a recurrent theme in science fiction, whether utopian, emphasising the potential benefits, or dystopian, emphasising the dangers. The notion of machines with human-like intelligence dates back at least to Samuel Butler's 1872 novel Erewhon. Since then, many science fiction stories have presented different effects of creating such intelligence, often involving rebellions by robots. Among the best known of these are Stanley Kubrick's 1968 2001: A Space Odyssey with its murderous onboard computer HAL 9000, contrasting with the more benign R2-D2 in George Lucas's 1977 Star Wars and the eponymous robot in the 2008 WALL-E. Scientists and engineers have noted the implausibility of many science fiction scenarios, but have mentioned fictional robots many times in artificial intelligence research articles, most often in a utopian context. ==Background== The notion of advanced robots with human-like intelligence dates back at least to Samuel Butler's 1872 novel Erewhon.\"Darwin among the Machines\", reprinted in the Notebooks of Samuel Butler at Project Gutenberg * This drew on an earlier (1863) article of his, Darwin among the Machines, where he raised the question of the evolution of consciousness among self-replicating machines that might supplant humans as the dominant species. Similar ideas were also discussed by others around the same time as Butler, including George Eliot in a chapter of her final published work Impressions of Theophrastus Such (1879). The creature in Mary Shelley's 1818 Frankenstein has also been considered an artificial being, for instance by the science fiction author Brian Aldiss. Beings with at least some appearance of intelligence were imagined, too, in classical antiquity. == Utopian and dystopian visions == Artificial intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals. It is\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Artificial imagination\nContent: artificial intelligence is whether human beings should take responsibility for machines‘ mistakes or decisions and how to develop well-behaved machines. As nobody can give a clear description of the best moral rules, it is impossible to create machines with commonly accepted moral rules. However, recent research about artificial morals circumvent the definition of moral. Instead, machine learning methods are applied to train machines to imitate human morals. As the data about moral decisions from thousands of different people are considered, the trained moral model can reflect widely accepted rules. Memory is another major field of artificial imagination. Researchers such as Aude Oliva have performed extensive work on artificial memory, especially visual memory. Compared to visual imagination, the visual memory focuses more on how machine understand, analyse and store pictures in a human way. In addition, characters like spatial features are also considered. As this field is based on the brains' biological structures, extensive research on neuroscience has also been performed, which makes it a large intersection between biology and computer science. ==References== Category:Applications of artificial intelligence Category:Philosophy of artificial intelligence\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Artificial general intelligence\nContent: text: An artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a type of hypothetical intelligent agent. The AGI concept is that it can learn to accomplish any intellectual task that human beings or animals can perform. Alternatively, AGI has been defined as an autonomous system that surpasses human capabilities in the majority of economically valuable tasks. Creating AGI is a primary goal of some artificial intelligence research and companies such as OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic. AGI is a common topic in science fiction and futures studies. The timeline for AGI development remains a subject of ongoing debate among researchers and experts. Some argue that it may be possible in years or decades, others maintain it might take a century or longer, and a minority believe it may never be achieved. Additionally, there is debate regarding whether modern deep learning systems, such as GPT-4, are an early yet incomplete form of AGI or if new approaches are required. Contention exists over the potential for AGI to pose a threat to humanity; for example, OpenAI treats it as an existential risk, while others find the development of AGI to be too remote to present a risk. A 2020 survey identified 72 active AGI R&D; projects spread across 37 countries. == Terminology == AGI is also known as strong AI,: Kurzweil describes strong AI as \"machine intelligence with the full range of human intelligence.\" full AI, or general intelligent action. However, some academic sources reserve the term \"strong AI\" for computer programs that experience sentience or consciousness.

The idea was first proposed in the 1950s and 1960s by cybernetics and early computer pioneers. IA is sometimes contrasted with AI (artificial intelligence), that is, the project of building a human-like intelligence in the form of an autonomous technological system such as a computer or robot. AI has encountered many fundamental obstacles, practical as well as theoretical, which for IA seem moot, as it needs technology merely as an extra support for an autonomous intelligence that has already proven to function. Moreover, IA has a long history of success, since all forms of information technology, from the abacus to writing to the Internet, have been developed basically to extend the information processing capabilities of the human mind (see extended mind and distributed cognition). ==Major contributions== ===William Ross Ashby: Intelligence Amplification=== The term intelligence amplification (IA) has enjoyed a wide currency since William Ross Ashby wrote of \"amplifying intelligence\" in his Introduction to Cybernetics (1956).

In Korea, the food delivery services include Baedal Minjok, Yogiyo, Uber Eats, and CoupangEats. Korea online food delivery industry is expected to reach $10 billion by 2020. In the GCC Region, after Uber Eats decided to close its operations in Middle Eastern markets, major food delivery services include now Careem Now, Deliveroo, Talabat and Noon Food since 2021. === Software platforms === As the number of restaurant food delivery systems has increased, so have the logistical challenges of tracking online orders—restaurants using delivery services usually must have each service's tablet or iPad to receive orders, which then must be transferred into the restaurant's own point-of- sales system. To streamline this, software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies have emerged to integrate the online ordering, billing and dispatching of restaurant food orders. In addition to providing online ordering software for restaurant chains (e.g. Applebee’s, Cheesecake Factory, Chipotle, Shake Shack), these SaaS companies' digital platforms also provide data analysis that these restaurants use for medium- and long-term planning. The application created for food delivery have positive influences on the performance and profits of the restaurant. Besides, it also can help to save money and time for both restaurant and customers. Moreover, COVID-19 has brought food delivery service to another level. The demand for online food delivery services increased significantly before the COVID-19 pandemic, which amounts to the US$31 billion. Researcher Ahn also mentions that the revenue in the online food delivery segment increased from $76.195 billion in 2017 and aims to achieve $136.431 billion in 2022; the population of food delivery application users is expected to reach 965.8 million people by 2024. ==Working conditions== In May 2022, workers in two of\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Roadie (app)\nContent: and Roadies networks. The relationship between the companies goes back several years with UPS being an early investor. Earlier in 2021, UPS had begun a pilot program testing same-day deliveries via Roadies. == Operations == === On-the-way model === Roadie’s app works by connecting drivers with senders, businesses or consumers who have items that need to be delivered. Deliveries within the app are referred to as \"Gigs\", which Gorlin said was inspired by live music road crews, also known as roadies. A sender creates a Gig on Roadie's web app or via its API. Drivers then review deliveries in their area on their mobile app and may choose to offer to take on individual or groups of deliveries along the same route. Gigs are then assigned to drivers by Roadie's algorithm. According to the company, this model encourages drivers to choose Gigs that align with their planned schedules and routes. Roadie calls this its \"on-the-way\" delivery model. The go-to-market approach taken by Roadie also differs from its competitors. Rather than launching in major cities and sequentially adding new markets city-by-city, Roadie launched nationwide from its inception. The company relies on retail and airline partners to drive volume of deliveries in individual markets, which in turn builds up a network of drivers in those areas, making it easier for small businesses and consumers to send deliveries as well. This strategy allows Roadie to reach smaller cities and towns in rural or exurban communities, traditionally difficult markets for delivery providers to serve. === Service lines === Roadie’s platform is most popular for same-day, on-demand or scheduled first mile/last mile delivery, especially delivery from stores and warehouses.

It operates in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Singapore, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar. It formerly operated in Germany, Taiwan, Spain, the Netherlands, and Australia. Its subsidiary operation, Deliveroo Editions operates ghost kitchens—kitchens not on restaurant sites—for the preparation of delivery-only meals. Deliveroo HOP operates from delivery-only grocery stores run by Deliveroo, working in partnership with existing grocers. Deliveroo also provides delivery and technology for on-demand grocery to major UK retailers. The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange on 31 March 2021 as Deliveroo Holdings plc. It is seen by some as being among the worst IPOs in the history of the London exchange. In 2022, in its first annual report since listing, Deliveroo showed growth in Gross Transaction Value of 70% year-on-year in constant currency. ==Business== ===History and basic operations=== Deliveroo, headquartered in London, was founded in 2013 by Will Shu and Greg Orlowski. The company makes revenue by charging restaurants a commission fee, as well as by charging customers a per-order fee for delivery. It operates in two hundred cities in the UK, France, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Singapore, United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong. In 2022, Deliveroo launched an advertising platform enabling businesses to promote products across its app. Customers place orders through its app or website, then self-employed bicycle or motorcycle couriers transport orders from restaurants to them. In November 2017, Deliveroo introduced Deliveroo Plus, a subscription service which gives customers in the UK unlimited free delivery.

If they choose to create their own website, they make sure to obtain software that manages the orders efficiently, meaning it has the capability to manage different orders at once. When they hire a vendor, the restaurant pays for a monthly fee or percentage- based fees. The vendor covers the developmental costs. A customer can choose to have the food delivered or for pick-up/take-away. The process consists of a customer choosing the restaurant of their choice, scanning the menu items, choosing an item, and finally choosing for pick-up or delivery. Payment is then administered by paying with a credit card or debit card through the app or website or in cash at the restaurant when going to pickup. The website and app inform the customer of the food quality, duration of food preparation, and when the food is ready for pick-up or the amount of time it will take for delivery. Papa John's is one of the restaurants that created their own Papa John's system, website, and app, and do their own delivery. In 2010, they redesigned their website and launched mobile apps for iPhones, iPads, iPods, Androids Phones, Blackberrys, and Windows Phones. The preexisting delivery infrastructure of these franchises paired with the online ordering system. In 2010, Papa John's International announced that its online sales had exceeded $2 billion. ===Independent websites=== In this case, a person cooks and offers meals or kits via their website, which are then directly sent to consumers.

Increasing global temperature, more frequent occurrence of extreme weather, and rising sea level are examples of the most impactful effects of climate change. Possible consequences of these effects include species decline and extinction, change within ecosystems, increased prevalence of invasive species, forests converting from carbon sinks to carbon sources, ocean acidification, disruption of the water cycle, and increased occurrence of natural disasters. ==General== Climate change is affecting terrestrial ecoregions. Increasing global temperature means that ecosystems are changing; some species are being forced out of their habitats (possibly to extinction) because of changing conditions. An example is migration. Due to the ever hotter weather, birds are forced to move to foreign lands. Other effects of global warming include less snow fall, rising sea levels, Ozone depleting and weather changes. These may influence human activities and the ecosystem. Within the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, experts assessed the literature on the impacts of climate change on ecosystems. Rosenzweig et al. (2007) concluded that over the last three decades, human-induced warming had likely had a discernible influence on many physical and biological systems (p. 81). Schneider et al. (2007) concluded, with very high confidence, that regional temperature trends had already affected species and ecosystems around the world (p. 792). They also concluded that climate change would result in the extinction of many species and a reduction in the diversity of different types of ecosystems (p. 792). * Terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity: With a warming of 4-5 °C, relative to 2010 levels, it is likely that global terrestrial vegetation would become a net source of carbon (Schneider et al., 2007:792).

Climate change is now the most serious global environmental threat. Its potential impacts include global warming, sea level rise, and increased extreme weather events. Climate change is a direct consequence of elevated greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. Some examples include Carbon dioxide, Methane, and Nitrous oxide. They are emitted from fossil fuel burning. Electricity production generates the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, other sources include transportation, industry, and agriculture. == Effects of greenhouse gases == These gases are said to make the planet warmer by \"thickening the Earth’s blanket.\" This can lead to the overall average annual temperature to increase. Moreover, global warming will decrease snow and glaciers resulting in rising sea levels and increased coastal flooding. In addition, continued warming from the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is expected to have substantial impacts on the economy, other environmental issues and human health. Warming is likely to worsen conditions for air quality and increase the risk of heat-related illnesses. In addition, the frequency and strength of extreme event such as floods and storms are likely to threaten safety and health. In turn, warming temperatures are likely to change water resources which affect many areas, including energy production, human health, agriculture, and ecosystems. ==Steam to hot water conversion action plan== In 2011, the University of British Columbia (UBC) created one of the largest steam to hot water conversions to replace UBC's old steam system. The new system will increase operational efficiencies by reducing heat distribution losses. It will heat the campus while operating at a significantly lower average temperature of 80 °C,\n\nID: 2\nTitle: 2020 in the environment and environmental sciences\nContent: warming and sea ice loss from 1955 to 2005.

Changes in the climate system include an overall warming trend, more extreme weather and rising sea levels. These in turn impact nature and wildlife, as well as human settlements and societies. The effects of human- caused climate change are broad and far-reaching, especially if significant climate action is not taken. The projected and observed negative impacts of climate change are sometimes referred to as the climate crisis. The changes in climate are not uniform across the Earth. In particular, most land areas have warmed faster than most ocean areas, and the Arctic is warming faster than most other regions. Among the effects of climate change on oceans are an increase of ocean temperatures, a rise in sea level from ocean warming and ice sheet melting, increased ocean stratification, and changes to ocean currents including a weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is acidifiying the ocean. Recent warming has strongly affected natural biological systems. It has degraded land by raising temperatures, drying soils and increasing wildfire risk.IPCC, 2019: Summary for Policymakers.

Their status and possible effects involve controversy over the degree of social impact or the viability of the technologies. Though, these represent new and significant developments within a field; converging technologies represent previously distinct fields which are in some way moving towards stronger inter-connection and similar goals. ==Challenges and problems== ===Climate change=== Climate change and global warming reflects the notion of the modern climate. The changes of climate over the past century, have been attributed to various factors which have resulted in a global warming. This warming is the increase in the average temperature of the Earth's near-surface air and oceans since the mid-20th century and its projected continuation. Some effects on both the natural environment and human life are, at least in part, already being attributed to global warming. A 2001 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests that glacier retreat, ice shelf disruption such as that of the Larsen Ice Shelf, sea level rise, changes in rainfall patterns, and increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events are attributable in part to global warming. Other expected effects include water scarcity in some regions and increased precipitation in others, changes in mountain snowpack, and adverse health effects from warmer temperatures. It usually is impossible to connect specific weather events to human impact on the world. Instead, such impact is expected to cause changes in the overall distribution and intensity of weather events, such as changes to the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation. Broader effects are expected to include glacial retreat, Arctic shrinkage, and worldwide sea level rise. Other effects may include changes in crop yields, addition of new trade routes, species extinctions, and changes in the range of disease vectors.

A retired journalist for The New York Times, William K. Stevens wrote: \"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said the likelihood was 90 percent to 99 percent that emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, spewed from tailpipes and smokestacks, were the dominant cause of the observed warming of the last 50 years.

According to James Kulik, who studies the effectiveness of computers used for instruction, students usually learn more in less time when receiving computer-based instruction, and they like classes more and develop more positive attitudes toward computers in computer-based classes. Students can independently solve problems. There are no intrinsic age-based restrictions on difficulty level, i.e. students can go at their own pace.

Additionally, many learning resources online are free, easy to access, self-paced, and beginner- friendly. Potential disadvantages: * Remote learning can reduce engagement, interaction, and lead to a lack of socialization, which can potentially decrease a student's social competence or skills such as their ability to cooperate with others. * A home or online environment may potentially be more distracting or disrupting than a physical school environment. * Organizing an online school may be more expensive and more complicated to organize or lead. * Those without access to technology or devices would not have access to virtual education. Although some schools may offer students borrowed devices, those who do not have access can easily fall behind. * Many virtual schools are relatively new and inexperienced, and therefore may be unfit for educating students properly. * Technology or the Internet can be more unpredictable since it may be vulnerable to power outages, Internet outages, hacks, exploits, online trolling, glitches, or errors that can potentially be more difficult to fix or deal with when online. * Potential employers may be skeptical of the credibility of online degrees and virtual programs. * Cheating online may be easier or more tempting since online resources may be more accessible and restrictions or consequences may be more lenient. The increased anonymity online may further encourage or allow the continuance of misbehavior such as trolling. * Online schools may be too lenient or disengaging, thus may potentially encourage or harbor potentially damaging and undisciplined behavior that could threaten a student's future or career. *\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Educational technology\nContent: MA: MIT Press. put heavy emphasis on the use of learning networks. With the advent of World Wide Web in the 1990s, teachers embarked on the method of using emerging technologies to employ multi-object oriented sites, which are text-based online virtual reality systems, to create course websites along with simple sets of instructions for their students. By 1994, the first online high school had been founded. In 1997, Graziadei described criteria for evaluating products and developing technology-based courses that include being portable, replicable, scalable, affordable, and having a high probability of long-term cost-effectiveness.Graziadei, W. D., et al., 1997. Building Asynchronous and Synchronous Teaching-Learning Environments: Exploring a Course/Classroom Management System Solution . Improved Internet functionality enabled new schemes of communication with multimedia or webcams. The National Center for Education Statistics estimates the number of K 12 students enrolled in online distance learning programs increased by 65% from 2002 to 2005, with greater flexibility, ease of communication between teacher and student, and quick lecture and assignment feedback. According to a 2008 study conducted by the U.S Department of Education, during the 2006–2007 academic year about 66% of postsecondary public and private schools participating in student financial aid programs offered some distance learning courses; records show 77% of enrollment in for- credit courses with an online component. In 2008, the Council of Europe passed a statement endorsing e-learning's potential to drive equality and education improvements across the EU. Computer-mediated communication (CMC) is between learners and instructors, mediated by the computer. In contrast, CBT/CBL usually means individualized (self-study) learning, while CMC involves educator/tutor facilitation and requires the scalarization of flexible learning activities. In addition, modern ICT provides education with tools for sustaining learning communities and associated knowledge management tasks.

On the other hand, The Chronicle of Higher Education reported in January 2007 on a Vault Inc. survey that found 55 percent of employers preferred traditional degrees over online ones. Forty-one percent, however, said they would give \"equal consideration to both types of degrees.\" The Sloan Consortium, an organization funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to maintain and improve the quality of distance education, publishes regular reports on the state of United States distance education. In its 2006 report \"Making the Grade: Online Education in the United States, 2006,\" it stated that \"in 2003, 57 percent of academic leaders rated the learning outcomes in online education as the same or superior to those in face-to-face. That number is now 62 percent, a small but noteworthy increase.\" According to Steve Lohr's article in the New York Times, a major study was done in 2009 that was funded by the Education Department. The collected research was from a 12-year period and concluded that online learning on average beat face-to-face teaching by a small but statistical margin.Lohr, Steve. “Second Thoughts On Web Classes.” New York Times 13 Sept. 2010: 3 Academic Search Complete.

In many cases, an online degree earned through an accredited public or private university may be effectively indistinguishable from a degree earned in a campus-based program, the latter sometimes referred to as \"brick-and-mortar\" programs. The instruction is often exactly the same, with the online degree containing no special designation. As such the same financial aid packages are often available to online students, which has helped make them more accessible to traditional applicants. An example of an indistinguishable degree program is that offered by Columbia University.

Also, depending on the location of the bus depot, replacement buses may be dispatched from the depot to fill in other gaps, starting the timetable part way along the route. There is a common cliché that people \"wait all day, and then three come along at once\", in relation to a phenomenon where evenly timetabled bus services can develop a gap in service followed by buses turning up almost simultaneously. This occurs when the rush hour begins and numbers of passengers at a stop increases, increasing the loading time, and thus delay scheduled service. The following bus then catches up because it begins to be delayed less at stops due to fewer passengers waiting. This is called bus bunching. This is prevented in some cities such as Berlin by assigning every stop arrival times where scheduled buses should arrive no earlier than specified. Some services may have no specific departure times, the timetable giving the frequency of service on a route at particular phases of the day. This may be specified with departure times, but the over-riding factor is ensuring the regularity of buses arriving at stops. These are often the more frequent services, up to the busiest bus rapid transit schemes. For headway-based schemes, problems can be managed by changing speed, delaying at stops and leap-frogging a bus boarding at a stop. Services may be strictly regulated in terms of level of adherence to timetables, and how often timetables may be changed. Operators and authorities may employ on-street bus inspectors to monitor adherence in real time. Service operators often have a control room, or in the case of large operations, route controllers, who can monitor the level of service on routes and can take\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Bus stop\nContent: procure the bus service, known as the \"customer\" in the commercial charter sector.Bus Safety Act 2009, section 16. All of these persons can clearly affect bus safety. They are required by the Bus Safety Act to ensure that, in carrying out their activities, they eliminate risks to health and safety if 'practicable' - or work to reduce those risks 'so far as is reasonably practicable'. This familiar practicability formula is borrowed from Victoria's Rail Safety Act (and a subsequent national model Rail Safety Bill) and the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004. == Research == Many transit agencies have developed guidelines for preferred bus stop spacing. In most US cities, however, the typical bus stop spacing is between 650 and 900 feet (200–275 m), well below the optimal. Bus stop capacity is often an important consideration in the planning of bus stops serving multiple routes within urban centers. Limited capacity may mean buses queue up behind each other at the bus stop, which can cause traffic blockages or delays. Bus stop capacity is typically measured in terms of buses/hour that can reliably use the bus stop. The main factors that affect bus stop capacity are: * Number of loading areas (or number of buses that can stop at one time) * Average dwell time (How much time it takes a bus to load/unload passengers) * G/C ratio of nearby traffic signal (green time / cycle length) * Clearance time (time it takes bus to re-enter the traffic stream) Detailed procedures for calculating bus stop capacity and bus lane capacity using skip stops are outlined in Part 4 of the Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual, published by the US Transportation Research Board.

Some work on this problem was featured in the 2008 \"Year in Ideas\" issue of The New York Times Magazine. ==Research== The dilemma has been studied in an unpublished report entitled \"Walk Versus Wait: The Lazy Mathematician Wins.\" Anthony B. Morton's paper \"A Note on Walking Versus Waiting\" supports and extends Chen et al.'s results. Ramnik Arora's \"A Note on Walk versus Wait: Lazy Mathematician Wins\" discusses what he believes to be some of the errors in Chen et al.'s argument; the result of Chen et al.'s paper still holds following Arora's alleged corrections. As early as 1990, writer Tom Parker had observed that \"walking is faster than waiting for a bus if you're going less than a mile\".Excerpts from the book \"Never Trust a Calm Dog and Other Rules of Thumb\", as reproduced in the Gatesway Messenger.

Kominers first began fixating on the problem while walking from MIT to Harvard, which are more than a mile apart in Cambridge, Massachusetts along MBTA bus route 1. He enlisted the help of Caltech physics major Justin G. Chen and Harvard statistics major Robert W. Sinnott to perform the analysis. Their paper concludes that it is usually mathematically quicker to wait for the bus, at least for a little while. But once made, the decision to walk should be final instead of waiting again at subsequent stops. The paper also showed potential applications to the field of cryptography. ==Interstellar travel==\n\nID: 3\nTitle: 2019 Totnes bus crash\nContent: crash occurred at 10:50 local time, close to the village of Berry Pomeroy. Travelling westbound along the A385, the bus driver, 19-year-old Kameron Allan, became distracted for around 18 seconds by his jacket flapping from the opened cab window of the bus. While Allan was distracted by attempts to retrieve these items, the bus left the road at a sharp left-hand bend in an area of open country. After mounting the grass verge and crashing through a hedgerow along the outside of the bend, the bus fell down an embankment, coming to rest on its side in a grassy field close to the road. According to an eyewitness on board, the entire incident panned out during the space of only around five seconds, which started with the bus beginning to shake and several passengers screaming; there was then a change in momentum as the bus fell over onto the passenger side. Several passengers had to climb over unconscious bodies to escape from the wreckage. ===Emergency response=== Following the crash, Devon and Cornwall Police declared a major incident. Thirteen ambulances attended the scene by road, and four air ambulance helicopters were dispatched to the incident site to attend to the most severely injured passengers. More than 140 emergency services personnel attended the scene at the peak of the major incident, including firefighters who cut into the roof of the overturned bus to rescue passengers trapped inside the top deck. Out of the more than fifty people injured in the crash (including the bus driver), 37 people were taken to five different hospitals throughout Devon. Eight people suffered serious injuries and had to be stretchered out of the top deck through holes cut into the roof; there were no fatalities.

The American Public Transportation Association estimated that, at the beginning of 2009, around half of all transit buses in the United States were already using a GPS-based vehicle tracking system to trigger automated stop announcements. This can refer to external announcements (triggered by the opening of the bus's door) at a bus stop, announcing the vehicle's route number and destination, primarily for the benefit of visually impaired customers, or to internal announcements (to passengers already on board) identifying the next stop, as the bus (or tram) approaches a stop, or both; the latter are often also displayed on an internal LED display or LCD monitor connected to the system while the loudspeakers play them. Data collected as a transit vehicle follows its route is often continuously fed into a computer program which compares the vehicle's actual location and time with its schedule, and in turn produces a frequently updating display for the driver, telling him/her how early or late he/she is at any given time, potentially making it easier to adhere more closely to the published schedule. Such programs are also used to provide customers with real-time information as to the waiting time until arrival of the next bus or tram/streetcar at a given stop, based on the nearest vehicles' actual progress at the time, rather than merely giving information as to\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Anniston and Birmingham bus attacks\nContent: main highway. The Klansmen onboard the bus did not object to this, puzzling the somewhat relieved Freedom Riders. They were not aware that they were being saved for another mob which would be awaiting them in Birmingham. For the two hour journey to Birmingham, the Klansmen heckled the Riders, brandishing weapons at them and implying an ill fate awaited them in Birmingham. One of them took Booker's latest copy of Jet, featuring an article on CORE and the Freedom Rides. Reading it infuriated the Klansmen further. ==== Preparations in Birmingham ==== Meanwhile, in downtown Birmingham, the assembled mob of Klansman was waiting by the Greyhound bus terminal, where they were still expecting the first bus. Minutes before the Trailways bus was due to arrive, Police Sergeant Cook placed a call to Rowe, alerting him to the situation. Rowe herded the Klansmen together and led them on a manic dash to the Trailways bus terminal, some three or four blocks away.

The routes on which it would be implemented were the and , which operated out of the 126th Street Depot in Manhattan. In 1997, the MTA awarded a second contract to Orbital to install a tracking system on the Long Island Bus system (now the independent Nassau Inter-County Express). An additional contract was awarded in 1999 for the MTA's Access-A-Ride paratransit service. The system would have included countdown clocks and interactive kiosks at stops, and recorded \"next stop\" announcements on buses (similar to that of modern subway cars and the still-used Clever Devices system used on the ex-MTA Long Island Bus/NICE Bus units). NYCT Buses would be monitored at the East New York Depot control center, and Long Island buses at a command center in Garden City. After four years, the company had missed most of its deadlines. The technology, meanwhile, was faulty because the skyscrapers in Manhattan blocked signals and the dead reckoning system had failed. The NYCT contract was terminated by the MTA in 2000.

They had been advised approximately forty-five minutes earlier by their supervisor about the incident at Tewksbury's store. As the officers watched, a red cargo van drove by at a low speed. The van pulled into the K-Mart lot, and its headlights were turned off. A few minutes later, the van's headlights came back on, and the van left the lot. However, the van returned within five minutes. The police officers became suspicious, and followed the van as it pulled into a parking lot near yet another convenience store. The officers pulled behind the van after summoning back-up assistance. One of the passengers, later identified as John Eastle Brewer, exited the van and approached the police car. Brewer identified himself as \"David Urey\" and told the police he had no identification. Brewer provided inconsistent stories about why he was in the area. One of the officers asked Brewer to remain in the cruiser while he approached the van. The van's driver, William Danny Woodall, and Byrd provided the officer with identification, which was called in to the dispatcher.

It is 1212 lines long, and has 101 stanzas of 12 lines each with the rhyme scheme ABABABABBCBC. Stanzas are grouped in sections of five (except for XV, which has six), and each section is marked by a capital letter in the manuscript; within each section, the stanzas are tied together by the repetition of a key \"link\"-word in the last line of each section, which is then echoed in the first line of the following section. The oft-praised \"roundness\" of the poem is thus emphasized, and the final link-word is repeated in the first line of the whole, forging a connection between the two ends of the poem and producing a structure that is itself circular. Alliteration is used frequently, but not consistently throughout the poem, and there are several other sophisticated poetic devices. ==Structure and content== The poem may be divided into three parts: an introduction (or \"Prologue\"), a dialogue between the two main characters in which the Pearl instructs the narrator, and a description of the New Jerusalem with the narrator's awakening. ===Prologue=== Sections I–IV (stanzas 1–20) The narrator, distraught at the loss of his Pearl, falls asleep in an \"erber grene\" – a green garden – and begins to dream. In his dream he is transported to an other-worldly garden; the divine is thus set in opposition to the terrestrial, a persistent thematic concern within the poem.

Generally, the line length is fixed at five or seven or characters per line; although, there are some poems which have a six character line-length. The line length is also used for the purpose of further classifying the main three forms of regulated verse into subtypes. *Rhyme is mandatory. Rhyme, or rime, is based on a sometimes somewhat technical rhyme scheme. The rhyme of a poem can be difficult to determine, especially for older poems as pronounced in modern versions of Chinese; however, even as early as the Tang dynasty, formal rhyme might be based upon authoritative references in a rime table or rime dictionary, rather than on actual vernacular speech. Generally level tones only rhyme with level tones, and non-level (or \"deflected\") tones only formally rhyme with other non-level tones. Also, the first line of the poem may also set the rhyme, more often in the seven-character form than the five- character. *The pattern of tonality within the poem is regulated according to certain fixed patterns of alternating level and deflected tones. Although there is some question as to the status of tone in older forms of Chinese, in Middle Chinese (characteristic of the Chinese of the Sui dynasty, Tang dynasty, and Song dynasty), a four tone system developed. For the purposes of regulated verse, the important distinction is between the level tone (píng 平, similar to the modern Mandarin Chinese first tone) and the other three tones which are grouped in the category of deflected tones (zè 仄). *Parallelism is a feature of regulated verse. The parallelism requirement means that the two parallel lines must match each word in each line with the word which is in the same position in the other line, the match can be in terms\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Poetry analysis\nContent: The poem also rhymes (not all poems do), and the rhymes follow a pattern (they do not have to). In this case, the rhymes come right next to each other, which emphasizes them, and therefore emphasizes the sound, the physical nature, of the language. The effect of the poem's language derives in part from Byron's choice of an appropriate pattern of rhyme (or rhyme scheme): these adjacent, rhyming lines are called couplets. The sound, the physical nature, of the language is also emphasized by alliteration, as in the repetition of s sounds in the third line: \"And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea\". ==Tools== ===Poetic forms=== Poems can have many forms. Some forms are strictly defined, with required line counts and rhyming patterns, such as the sonnet (mostly made of a 14 line poem with a defined rhyme scheme) or limerick (usually a 5 line free rhyme poem with AABBA rhyme shceme). Such poems exhibit closed form. Others (which exhibit open form) have less structure or, indeed, almost no apparent structure at all. This appearance, though, is deceptive: successful open form poems are informed throughout by organic structure which may resist formal description but is nonetheless a crucial element of the poem's effect on the reading mind. ====Closed forms==== A poet writing in closed form follows a specific pattern, a specific design. Some designs have proven so durable and so suited to the English language that they survive for centuries and are renewed with each generation of poets (sonnets, sestinas, limericks, and so forth), while others come into being for the expression of one poem and are then set aside (Frost's \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\" is a good example).

Examples: We find one rhyme scheme for a one-line poem (A), two different rhyme schemes for a two-line poem (AA, AB), and five for a three-line poem: AAA, AAB, ABA, ABB, and ABC. These counts, however, include rhyme schemes in which rhyme is not employed at all (ABCD). There are many fewer rhyme schemes when all lines must rhyme with at least one other line; a count of these is given by the numbers, :0, 1, 1, 4, 11, 41, 162, 715, 3425, 17722, ... . For example, for a three-line poem, there is only one rhyming scheme in which every line rhymes with at least one other (AAA), while for a four-line poem, there are four such schemes (AABB, ABAB, ABBA, and AAAA). ==References== ==External links== * Category:Rhyme Category:Stanzaic form hu:Rímképlet\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Line (poetry)\nContent: text: A line is a unit of language into which a poem or play is divided. The use of a line operates on principles which are distinct from and not necessarily coincident with grammatical structures, such as the sentence or single clauses in sentences. Although the word for a single poetic line is verse, that term now tends to be used to signify poetic form more generally. A line break is the termination of the line of a poem and the beginning of a new line. The process of arranging words using lines and line breaks is known as lineation, and is one of the defining features of poetry. A distinct numbered group of lines in verse is normally called a stanza. A title, in some poems, is considered a line. ==General conventions in Western poetry== Conventions that determine what might constitute line in poetry depend upon different constraints, aural characteristics or scripting conventions for any given language. On the whole, where relevant, a line is generally determined either by units of rhythm or repeating aural patterns in recitation that can also be marked by other features such as rhyme or alliteration, or by patterns of syllable-count.See, for example, the account in Geoffrey N Leech A Linguistic Guide to English Poetry, Longman, 1969. Section 7.3 \"Metre and the Line of Verse\", pp.111-19 in the 1991 edition. In Western literary traditions, use of line is arguably the principal feature which distinguishes poetry from prose. Even in poems where formal metre or rhyme is weakly observed or absent, the convention of line continues on the whole to be observed, at least in written representations, although there are exceptions (see Degrees of license). In such writing, simple visual appearance on a page (or any other written layout) remains\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Of Modern Poetry\nContent: a woman > Combing. The poem of the act of the mind. > == Analyzing the poem == The poem is divided in two parts by a blank line, and each of the two parts contains a broken line, suggesting quasi-paragraphs. Thus the first division of the poem is five lines with the fourth line broken in two. The second division, the longer one, is lines six through twenty-six, with its quasi-paragraph break at line twenty-three. This typography is a partial clue to the poem's structure. The poem begins and ends with non- sentences: \"The poem of the mind in the act of finding / What will suffice.\" And \"The poem of the act of the mind.\" Those are a subject and a recapitulation, but not a theme. By lacking a main verb, these lines avoid stating a theme. But more importantly they avoid tying the act of the mind to a time; the act of the mind is not past, present, or future. It is ongoing. These non-sentences also stress that the mind must act, not passively wait for inspiration or intuition. And the mind must seek to find \"what will suffice.\" What that says of modern poetry will be addressed metaphorically in the poem, the organizing metaphor being that of a new stage on which the modern poet will perform. The lines of the poem, non-traditional free verse, do not rhyme and are not metrical. They range from ten syllables to fourteen. One striking thing about the sounds of the poem is that three of the lines have weak endings; that is, the final words of these lines have unaccented syllables. The opening line quoted above has a weak ending--\"The poem of the mind in the act of finding.\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Classical Chinese poetry forms\nContent: tone- structure, or parallelism. A common rhyme scheme is the rhymed couplet, so that generally in rhymed poetry, the even numbered lines rhyme. Sometimes these couplets appear by themselves, for example one-half on each side of a door. ====Poem length==== Because of the tendency to write poetry as groups of couplets, most poems had an even number of lines. Generally four lines (two couplets) were considered to be the minimum length for a poem. In the case of curtailed verse (jueju), the poem was limited to this length. Other types of poems were limited to eight lines (four couplets). If the overall length of some form of poetry was not limited, the poems tended to be written using four- or eight-line stanzas, so the poem lengths would work out to multiples of four or eight. Some poems were quite long. The length of poems based upon specific song and ballad forms depended upon the specific tune or form selected as the model. The fu type of poem, which sometimes even incorporated sections of prose, had few limitations on line length, except that, within a section of verse, the line lengths tended to be of equal length.Frankel, 212–213 A specific poem's length for those forms in which this was a restriction, is another basic classifying criterion (as in Seven-character eight-line verse). ====Old, new, regulated, unregulated==== Poems of the same length in terms of line-length and poem-length and/or poems within the same general type were often distinguished by using the concepts \"new\", \"old\", \"regulated\", or \"unregulated\". =====\"Old\" versus \"new\"===== \"Old\" and \"new\" were generally used to denote a basic change of form within a mode or form, like \"old\" yuefu and \"new\"\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Generate a poem with 10 lines.\n\n[/INST]IDs: 6, 5</s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

All other countries now use Celsius (\"centigrade\" until 1948), a scale formalized about 20 years after the Fahrenheit scale. The United Kingdom started to change from Fahrenheit to Celsius in 1962, and many people remain aware of Fahrenheit temperatures; degrees Fahrenheit are sometimes used in newspaper headlines to sensationalize heatwaves. == Definition and conversion == Historically, on the Fahrenheit scale the freezing point of water was 32 °F, and the boiling point was 212 °F (at standard atmospheric pressure). This put the boiling and freezing points of water 180 degrees apart. Therefore, a degree on the Fahrenheit scale was of the interval between the freezing point and the boiling point. On the Celsius scale, the freezing and boiling points of water were originally defined to be 100 degrees apart. A temperature interval of 1 °F was equal to an interval of degrees Celsius. With the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales now both defined by the kelvin, this relationship was preserved, a temperature interval of 1 °F being equal to an interval of K and of °C. The Fahrenheit and Celsius scales intersect numerically at −40 in the respective unit (i.e, −40 °F ≘ −40 °C). Absolute zero is 0 K, −273.15 °C, or −459.67 °F. The Rankine temperature scale uses degree intervals of the same size as those of the Fahrenheit scale, except that absolute zero is 0 °R the same way that the Kelvin temperature scale matches the Celsius scale, except that absolute zero is 0 K. The combination of degree symbol (°) followed by an uppercase letter F is the conventional symbol for the Fahrenheit\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Fahrenheit\nContent: temperature is approximately 98.6 °F (oral temperature) on the revised scale (whereas it was 90° on Fahrenheit's multiplication of Rømer, and 96° on his original scale). In the present-day Fahrenheit scale, 0 °F no longer corresponds to the eutectic temperature of ammonium chloride brine as described above. Instead, that eutectic is at approximately 4 °F on the final Fahrenheit scale. The Rankine temperature scale was based upon the Fahrenheit temperature scale, with its zero representing absolute zero instead. ==Usage== ===General=== The Fahrenheit scale was the primary temperature standard for climatic, industrial and medical purposes in English-speaking countries until the 1960s. In the late 1960s and 1970s, the Celsius scale replaced Fahrenheit in almost all of those countries—with the notable exception of the United States and in certain cases, the United Kingdom—typically during their general metrication process. Fahrenheit is used in the United States, its territories and associated states (all served by the U.S. National Weather Service), as well as the Cayman Islands and Liberia for everyday applications. For example, U.S. weather forecasts, food cooking, and freezing temperatures are typically given in degrees Fahrenheit. Scientists, including meteorologists, use degrees Celsius or kelvin in all countries. thumb|upright ===United States=== Early in the 20th century, Halsey and Dale suggested that reasons for resistance to use the centigrade (now Celsius) system in the U.S. included the larger size of each degree Celsius and the lower zero point in the Fahrenheit system; put another way, the Fahrenheit scale is more intuitive than Celsius for describing outdoor temperatures in temperate latitudes, with 100 °F being a hot summer day and 0 °F a cold winter day. ===Canada=== Canada has passed legislation favoring the International System\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Fahrenheit\nContent: letter F is the conventional symbol for the Fahrenheit temperature scale. A number followed by this symbol (and separated from it with a space) denotes a specific temperature point (e.g., \"Gallium melts at 85.5763 °F\"). A difference between temperatures or an uncertainty in temperature is also conventionally written the same way as well, e.g., \"The output of the heat exchanger experiences an increase of 72 °F\" or \"Our standard uncertainty is ±5 °F\". However, some authors instead use the notation \"An increase of \" (reversing the symbol order) to indicate temperature differences. Similar conventions exist for the Celsius scale, see . === Conversion (specific temperature point) === For an exact conversion between degrees Fahrenheit and Celsius, and kelvins of a specific temperature point, the following formulas can be applied. Here, is the value in degrees Fahrenheit, the value in degrees Celsius, and the value in kelvins: * °F to °C: = * °C to °F: = × 1.8 + 32 * °F to K: = * K to °F: = × 1.8 − 459.67 There is also an exact conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit scales making use of the correspondence −40 °F ≘ −40 °C. Again, is the numeric value in degrees Fahrenheit, and the numeric value in degrees Celsius: * °F to °C: = − 40 * °C to °F: = ( + 40) × 1.8 − 40 === Conversion (temperature difference or interval) === When converting a temperature interval between the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales, only the ratio is used, without any constant (in this case, the interval has the same numeric value in kelvins as in degrees Celsius): * °F to °C or K: = = * °C or\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Conversion of units\nContent: example for which it cannot be used is the conversion between degrees Celsius and kelvins (or degrees Fahrenheit). Between degrees Celsius and kelvins, there is a constant difference rather than a constant ratio, while between degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit there is neither a constant difference nor a constant ratio. There is, however, an affine transform (x \\mapsto ax+b, rather than a linear transform x \\mapsto ax) between them. For example, the freezing point of water is 0 °C and 32 °F, and a 5 °C change is the same as a 9 °F change. Thus, to convert from units of Fahrenheit to units of Celsius, one subtracts 32 °F (the offset from the point of reference), divides by 9 °F and multiplies by 5 °C (scales by the ratio of units), and adds 0 °C (the offset from the point of reference). Reversing this yields the formula for obtaining a quantity in units of Celsius from units of Fahrenheit; one could have started with the equivalence between 100 °C and 212 °F, though this would yield the same formula at the end. Hence, to convert the numerical quantity value of a temperature T[F] in degrees Fahrenheit to a numerical quantity value T[C] in degrees Celsius, this formula may be used: :T[C] = (T[F] − 32) × 5/9. To convert T[C] in degrees Celsius to T[F] in degrees Fahrenheit, this formula may be used: :T[F] = (T[C] × 9/5) + 32. ===Example=== Starting with: :Z = n_i \\times [Z]_i replace the original unit [Z]_i with its meaning in terms of the desired unit [Z]_j, e.g. if [Z]_i = c_{ij} \\times [Z]_j, then: :Z = n_i\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Gas mark\nContent: \\frac { \\left ( C - 121 \\right ) }{14} These do not work for G less than 1.

The lowest temperature was achieved by preparing a frigorific mixture of ice, water, and a salt (\"ammonium chloride or even sea salt\"), and waiting for the eutectic system to reach equilibrium temperature. The thermometer then was placed into the mixture and the liquid in the thermometer allowed to descend to its lowest point. The thermometer's reading there was taken as . The second reference point was selected as the reading of the thermometer when it was placed in still water when ice was just forming on the surface. This was assigned as . The third calibration point, taken as , was selected as the thermometer's reading when the instrument was placed under the arm or in the mouth. Fahrenheit came up with the idea that mercury boils around 300 degrees on this temperature scale. Work by others showed that water boils about 180 degrees above its freezing point. The Fahrenheit scale later was redefined to make the freezing-to-boiling interval exactly 180 degrees, a convenient value as 180 is a highly composite number, meaning that it is evenly divisible into many fractions. It is because of the scale's redefinition that normal mean body temperature today is taken as 98.6 degrees, whereas it was 96 degrees on Fahrenheit's original scale. The Fahrenheit scale was the primary temperature standard for climatic, industrial and medical purposes in English-speaking countries until the 1970s, presently mostly replaced by the Celsius scale long used in the rest of the world, apart from the United States, where temperatures and weather reports are still broadcast in Fahrenheit. ==See also== * Fahrenheit hydrometer * People from Gdańsk (Danzig)\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Scott Air-Pak SCBA\nContent: PV = nRT.Universal gas constant What is particularly important to understand from the formula is that the temperature is in kelvins, not degrees Fahrenheit. Consider the freezing point of water at 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius) and compare it to 96 °F (35.6 °C; normal human body temperature is 37 °C). While 96 is arithmetically three times 32, the difference in temperature from a scientific point of view is not threefold. Instead of comparing 32 to 96, temperatures of 273.15 K and 308.71 K should be compared.Online Conversion – Temperature Conversion The actual scientifically valid change in temperature from 32 to 96 °F is by a factor of 1.13 (308.71/273.15), not 3. If an air cylinder is pressurized to 4,500 psi at 96 °F and later the temperature drops to 32 °F, the pressure gauge will indicate 4,000 psi (4,500/1.13). Stated differently, a drop in temperature of 10 degrees Fahrenheit causes a pressure decrease of about 82 psi. == References == Category:Pressure vessels Category:Firefighter tools\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Convert from celsius to fahrenheit.

Begin with the series written in the usual order, :1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{4} + \\cdots and rearrange the terms: :1 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{1}{12} + \\cdots where the pattern is: the first two terms are 1 and −1/2, whose sum is 1/2. The next term is −1/4. The next two terms are 1/3 and −1/6, whose sum is 1/6. The next term is −1/8. The next two terms are 1/5 and −1/10, whose sum is 1/10. In general, the sum is composed of blocks of three: :\\frac{1}{2k - 1} - \\frac{1}{2(2k - 1)} - \\frac{1}{4k},\\quad k = 1, 2, \\dots. This is indeed a rearrangement of the alternating harmonic series: every odd integer occurs once positively, and the even integers occur once each, negatively (half of them as multiples of 4, the other half as twice odd integers). Since :\\frac{1}{2k - 1} - \\frac{1}{2(2k - 1)} = \\frac{1}{2(2k - 1)}, this series can in fact be written: :\\begin{align} &\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{10} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{2(2k - 1)} - \\frac{1}{2(2k)} + \\cdots \\\\\\ ={}& \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} - \\cdots\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln(2) \\end{align} which is half the usual sum. ===Getting an arbitrary\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Magic square\nContent: and the third on the bottom, and the fourth at the top, and so on until there remains in the top row (excluding the corners) six empty cells.

In order to ensure that the numbers representing the k-combinations of } are less than those representing k-combinations not contained in }, the k-combinations must be ordered in such a way that their largest elements are compared first. The most natural ordering that has this property is lexicographic ordering of the decreasing sequence of their elements. So comparing the 5-combinations C = {0,3,4,6,9} and C′ = {0,1,3,7,9}, one has that C comes before C′, since they have the same largest part 9, but the next largest part 6 of C is less than the next largest part 7 of C′; the sequences compared lexicographically are (9,6,4,3,0) and (9,7,3,1,0). Another way to describe this ordering is view combinations as describing the k raised bits in the binary representation of a number, so that C = {c1, ..., ck} describes the number :2^{c_1}+2^{c_2}+\\cdots+2^{c_k} (this associates distinct numbers to all finite sets of natural numbers); then comparison of k-combinations can be done by comparing the associated binary numbers. In the example C and C′ correspond to numbers 10010110012 = 60110 and 10100010112 = 65110, which again shows that C comes before C′. This number is not however the one one wants to represent the k-combination with, since many binary numbers have a number of raised bits different from k; one wants to find the relative position of C in the ordered list of (only) . == Place of a combination in the ordering == The number associated in the combinatorial number system of degree k to a k-combination C is the number of k-combinations strictly less than C in the given ordering.

The blocks themselves are ordered recursively, according to the Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm for one less element. Within each block, the positions in which n is placed occur either in descending or ascending order, and the blocks alternate between these two orders: the placements of n in the first block are in descending order, in the second block they are in ascending order, in the third block they are in descending order, and so on.; , section 3 Thus, from the single permutation on one element, one may place the number 2 in each possible position in descending order to form a list of two permutations on two elements, Then, one may place the number 3 in each of three different positions for these two permutations, in descending order for the first permutation 1 2, and then in ascending order for the permutation 2 1: The same placement pattern, alternating between descending and ascending placements of n, applies for any larger value of n. In sequences of permutations with this recursive structure, each permutation differs from the previous one either by the single-position- at-a-time motion of n, or by a change of two smaller numbers inherited from the previous sequence of shorter permutations. In either case this difference is just the transposition of two adjacent elements.

This ordering is a total order: every positive integer appears exactly once somewhere on this list. However, it is not a well-order. In a well-order, every subset would have an earliest element, but in this order there is no earliest power of two. Sharkovskii's theorem states that if f has a periodic point of least period m, and m precedes n in the above ordering, then f has also a periodic point of least period n. One consequence is that if f has only finitely many periodic points, then they must all have periods that are powers of two. Furthermore, if there is a periodic point of period three, then there are periodic points of all other periods. Sharkovskii's theorem does not state that there are stable cycles of those periods, just that there are cycles of those periods. For systems such as the logistic map, the bifurcation diagram shows a range of parameter values for which apparently the only cycle has period 3. In fact, there must be cycles of all periods there, but they are not stable and therefore not visible on the computer-generated picture. The assumption of continuity is important.

The number system in use at that time could express numbers up to a myriad (μυριάς — 10,000), and by utilizing the word myriad itself, one can immediately extend this to naming all numbers up to a myriad myriads (108). Archimedes called the numbers up to 108 \"first order\" and called 108 itself the \"unit of the second order\". Multiples of this unit then became the second order, up to this unit taken a myriad-myriad times, 108·108=1016. This became the \"unit of the third order\", whose multiples were the third order, and so on. Archimedes continued naming numbers in this way up to a myriad-myriad times the unit of the 108-th order, i.e., (108)^(108) After having done this, Archimedes called the orders he had defined the \"orders of the first period\", and called the last one, (10^8)^{(10^8)}, the \"unit of the second period\".

If the dimensions of the cube were multiplied by 2, its surface area would be multiplied by the square of 2 and become 24 m2. Its volume would be multiplied by the cube of 2 and become 8 m3. The original cube (1m sides) has a surface area to volume ratio of 6:1. The larger (2m sides) cube has a surface area to volume ratio of (24/8) 3:1. As the dimensions increase, the volume will continue to grow faster than the surface area. Thus the square–cube law. This principle applies to all solids. ==Applications== ===Engineering=== When a physical object maintains the same density and is scaled up, its volume and mass are increased by the cube of the multiplier while its surface area increases only by the square of the same multiplier. This would mean that when the larger version of the object is accelerated at the same rate as the original, more pressure would be exerted on the surface of the larger object. Consider a simple example of a body of mass, M, having an acceleration, a, and surface area, A, of the surface upon which the accelerating force is acting. The force due to acceleration, F= M a and the thrust pressure, T = \\frac{F}{A} = M\\frac{a}{A}. Now, consider the object be exaggerated by a multiplier factor = x so that it has a new mass, M' = x^3 M, and the surface upon which the force is acting has a new surface area, A' = x^2 A.

As an example, a cube with sides of length 1 cm will have a surface area of 6 cm2 and a volume of 1 cm3. The surface to volume ratio for this cube is thus :\\mbox{SA:V} = \\frac{6~\\mbox{cm}^2}{1~\\mbox{cm}^3} = 6~\\mbox{cm}^{-1}. For a given shape, SA:V is inversely proportional to size. A cube 2 cm on a side has a ratio of 3 cm−1, half that of a cube 1 cm on a side. Conversely, preserving SA:V as size increases requires changing to a less compact shape. ==Physical chemistry== Materials with high surface area to volume ratio (e.g. very small diameter, very porous, or otherwise not compact) react at much faster rates than monolithic materials, because more surface is available to react. An example is grain dust: while grain is not typically flammable, grain dust is explosive. Finely ground salt dissolves much more quickly than coarse salt. A high surface area to volume ratio provides a strong \"driving force\" to speed up thermodynamic processes that minimize free energy. ==Biology== The ratio between the surface area and volume of cells and organisms has an enormous impact on their biology, including their physiology and behavior. For example, many aquatic microorganisms have increased surface area to increase their drag in the water. This reduces their rate of sink and allows them to remain near the surface with less energy expenditure. An increased surface area to volume ratio also means increased exposure to the environment. The finely-branched appendages of filter feeders such as krill provide\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Sphere\nContent: m has 52.4% the volume of a cube with edge length 1m, or about 0.524 m3. === Surface area === The surface area of a sphere of radius is: :A = 4\\pi r^2. Archimedes first derived this formula from the fact that the projection to the lateral surface of a circumscribed cylinder is area-preserving.. Another approach to obtaining the formula comes from the fact that it equals the derivative of the formula for the volume with respect to because the total volume inside a sphere of radius can be thought of as the summation of the surface area of an infinite number of spherical shells of infinitesimal thickness concentrically stacked inside one another from radius 0 to radius . At infinitesimal thickness the discrepancy between the inner and outer surface area of any given shell is infinitesimal, and the elemental volume at radius is simply the product of the surface area at radius and the infinitesimal thickness. At any given radius , the incremental volume () equals the product of the surface area at radius () and the thickness of a shell (): :\\delta V \\approx A(r) \\cdot \\delta r. The total volume is the summation of all shell volumes: :V \\approx \\sum A(r) \\cdot \\delta r. In the limit as approaches zero this equation becomes: :V = \\int_0^r A(r) \\, dr. Substitute : :\\frac43\\pi r^3 = \\int_0^r A(r) \\, dr. Differentiating both sides of this equation with respect to yields as a function of : :4\\pi r^2 = A(r).

The lateral surface area is the area of the lateral surface. This is to be distinguished from the total surface area, which is the lateral surface area together with the areas of the base and top. For a cube the lateral surface area would be the area of the four sides. If the edge of the cube has length , the area of one square face . Thus the lateral surface of a cube will be the area of four faces: . More generally, the lateral surface area of a prism is the sum of the areas of the sides of the prism. This lateral surface area can be calculated by multiplying the perimeter of the base by the height of the prism. For a right circular cylinder of radius and height , the lateral area is the area of the side surface of the cylinder: . For a pyramid, the lateral surface area is the sum of the areas of all of the triangular faces but excluding the area of the base. For a cone, the lateral surface area would be where is the radius of the circle at the bottom of the cone and is the lateral height (the length of a line segment from the apex of the cone along its side to its base) of the cone (given by the Pythagorean theorem where is the height of the cone) ==References== ==Further reading== * Lateral surface at Mathwords Category:Surfaces\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Surface-area-to-volume ratio\nContent: 5.72 Dodecahedron 70px edge 3\\sqrt{25+10\\sqrt{5}} a^2 \\frac{1}{4} (15+7\\sqrt{5}) a^3 \\frac{12\\sqrt{25+10\\sqrt{5}}}{(15+7\\sqrt{5})a} \\approx \\frac{2.694}{a} 5.31 Capsule 186x186px radius (R) 4\\pi a^2+2\\pi a \\cdot 2a = 8\\pi a^2 \\frac{4\\pi a^3}{3} + \\pi a^2 \\cdot 2a = \\frac{10\\pi a^3}{3} \\frac{12}{5a} 5.251 Icosahedron 70px edge 5\\sqrt{3}a^2 \\frac{5}{12} (3+\\sqrt5)a^3 \\frac{12 \\sqrt{3}}{(3+\\sqrt{5})a} \\approx \\frac{3.970}{a} 5.148 Sphere 70px radius 4\\pi a^2 \\frac{4\\pi a^3}{3} \\frac{3}{a} 4.83598 Examples of cubes of different sizes Side of cube Side2 Area of a single face 6 × side2 Area of entire cube (6 faces) Side3 Volume Ratio of surface area to volume 2 2×2 4 6×2×2 24 2×2×2 8 3:1 4 4×4 16 6×4×4 96 4×4×4 64 3:2 6 6×6 36 6×6×6 216 6×6×6 216 3:3 8 8×8 64 6×8×8 384 8×8×8 512 3:4 12 12×12 144 6×12×12 864 12×12×12 1,728 3:6 20 20×20 400 6×20×20 2,400 20×20×20 8,000 3:10 50 50×50 2,500 6×50×50 15,000 50×50×50 125,000 3:25 1,000 1,000×1,000 1,000,000 6×1,000×1,000 6,000,000 1,000×1,000×1,000 1,000,000,000 3:500 ==See also== *Compactness measure of a shape *Dust explosion *Square–cube law *Specific surface area ==References== * * ;Specific ==External links== *Sizes of Organisms: The Surface Area:Volume Ratio *National Wildfire Coordinating Group: Surface Area to Volume Ratio *Previous link not working, references are in this document, PDF ==Further reading== *On Being the Right Size, J.B.S.

We don't know the actual surface area, but we might assume that all values are equally likely and simply pick the mid-value of 102 cm2. *The information on the label allows us to calculate that the volume of the cube is between 27 and 125 cm3. We don't know the actual volume, but we might assume that all values are equally likely and simply pick the mid-value of 76 cm3. *However, we have now reached the impossible conclusion that the cube has a side length of 4 cm, a surface area of 102 cm2, and a volume of 76 cm3! In this example, mutually contradictory estimates of the length, surface area, and volume of the cube arise because we have assumed three mutually contradictory distributions for these parameters: a uniform distribution for any one of the variables implies a non-uniform distribution for the other two. In general, the principle of indifference does not indicate which variable (e.g. in this case, length, surface area, or volume) is to have a uniform epistemic probability distribution. Another classic example of this kind of misuse is the Bertrand paradox. Edwin T. Jaynes introduced the principle of transformation groups, which can yield an epistemic probability distribution for this problem. This generalises the principle of indifference, by saying that one is indifferent between equivalent problems rather than indifferent between propositions. This still reduces to the ordinary principle of indifference when one considers a permutation of the labels as generating equivalent problems (i.e. using the permutation transformation group). To apply this to the above box example, we have three random variables related by geometric equations.

Such a rectangle can be obtained by halving a square, or by placing two equal squares side by side. This can be used to subdivide a square grid into a tilted square grid with five times as many squares, forming the basis for a subdivision surface. Together with the algebraic relationship between \\sqrt{5} and , this forms the basis for the geometrical construction of a golden rectangle from a square, and for the construction of a regular pentagon given its side (since the side- to-diagonal ratio in a regular pentagon is ). Since two adjacent faces of a cube would unfold into a 1:2 rectangle, the ratio between the length of the cube's edge and the shortest distance from one of its vertices to the opposite one, when traversing the cube surface, is \\sqrt{5}. By contrast, the shortest distance when traversing through the inside of the cube corresponds to the length of the cube diagonal, which is the square root of three times the edge.

Calculating the gravity at Earth's surface using the average radius of Earth (), the experimentally determined value of the gravitational constant, and the Earth mass of 5.9722 kg gives an acceleration of 9.8203 m/s2, slightly greater than the standard gravity of 9.80665 m/s2. The value of standard gravity corresponds to the gravity on Earth at a radius of . ===Latitude=== thumb|upright=1.4|The differences of Earth's gravity around the Antarctic continent. The surface of the Earth is rotating, so it is not an inertial frame of reference. At latitudes nearer the Equator, the outward centrifugal force produced by Earth's rotation is larger than at polar latitudes. This counteracts the Earth's gravity to a small degree – up to a maximum of 0.3% at the Equator – and reduces the apparent downward acceleration of falling objects. The second major reason for the difference in gravity at different latitudes is that the Earth's equatorial bulge (itself also caused by centrifugal force from rotation) causes objects at the Equator to be further from the planet's center than objects at the poles. Because the force due to gravitational attraction between two bodies (the Earth and the object being weighed) varies inversely with the square of the distance between them, an object at the Equator experiences a weaker gravitational pull than an object on one of the poles. In combination, the equatorial bulge and the effects of the surface centrifugal force due to rotation mean that sea-level gravity increases from about 9.780 m/s2 at the Equator to about 9.832 m/s2 at the poles, so an object will weigh approximately 0.5% more at the poles than at the Equator.\"Curious About Astronomy?\", Cornell University, retrieved June 2007\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Gravitational metric system\nContent: converted to the SI unit newton by multiplication with the standard acceleration gn: :1 kp = gn ⋅ 1 kg = = == Units == ===Force=== In English contexts the unit of force is usually formed by simply appending the suffix \"force\" to the name of the unit of mass, thus gram-force (gf) or kilogram-force (kgf), which follows the tradition of pound- force (lbf).

According to Newton's law of gravitation, a gravitational force \\mathbf{F}_{G} acting on a mass m due to a mass M located at a distance r from m, obeys the equation \\mathbf{F}_{G} = - \\frac{G m M}{r^2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}, where G is the gravitational constant and \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} is a unit vector pointing from M toward m. The force of gravity is conservative because \\mathbf{F}_{G} = - abla \\Phi_{G}, where \\Phi_{G} ~ \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} - \\frac{G m M}{r} is the gravitational potential energy. In other words, the gravitation field \\frac{\\mathbf{F}_{G}}{m} associated with the gravitational force \\mathbf{F}_{G} is the gradient of the gravitation potential \\frac{\\Phi_{G}}{m} associated with the gravitational potential energy \\Phi_{G}. It can be shown that any vector field of the form \\mathbf{F}=F(r) \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} is conservative, provided that F(r) is integrable. For conservative forces, path independence can be interpreted to mean that the work done in going from a point A to a point B is independent of the moving path chosen (dependent on only the points A and B), and that the work W done in going around a simple closed loop C is 0: W = \\oint_{C} \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d{\\mathbf{r}} = 0. The total energy of a particle moving under the influence of conservative forces is conserved, in the sense that a loss of potential energy is converted to the equal quantity of kinetic energy, or vice versa. ==See also== * Beltrami vector field * Conservative force * Conservative system * Complex lamellar vector field * Helmholtz decomposition * Laplacian vector field * Longitudinal and transverse vector fields * Solenoidal vector field ==References==\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Newton's law of universal gravitation\nContent: that is located at radii causes the same force at the radius r0 as if all of the mass enclosed within a sphere of radius r0 was concentrated at the center of the mass distribution (as noted above). * The portion of the mass that is located at radii exerts no net gravitational force at the radius r0 from the center.

Whereas the gravitational force subjected by a celestial body on Earth varies inversely as the square of its distance to the Earth, the maximal tidal force varies inversely as, approximately, the cube of this distance. If the tidal force caused by each body were instead equal to its full gravitational force (which is not the case due to the free fall of the whole Earth, not only the oceans, towards these bodies) a different pattern of tidal forces would be observed, e.g. with a much stronger influence from the Sun than from the Moon: The solar gravitational force on the Earth is on average 179 times stronger than the lunar, but because the Sun is on average 389 times farther from the Earth, its field gradient is weaker. The overal proportionality is : \\text{tidal force} \\propto \\frac{M}{d^3} \\propto \\rho\\left(\\frac{r}{d}\\right)^3, where is the mass of the heavenly body, is its distance, is its average density, and is its radius. The ratio is related to the angle subtended by the object in the sky. Since the Sun and the Moon have practically the same diameter in the sky, the tidal force of the Sun is less than that of the Moon because its average density is much less, and it is only 46% as large as the lunar, thus during a spring tide, the Moon contributes 69% while the Sun contributes 31%. More precisely, the lunar tidal acceleration (along the Moon–Earth axis, at the Earth's surface) is about 1.1 g, while the solar tidal acceleration (along the Sun–Earth axis, at the Earth's surface) is about 0.52 g,\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Gravitational field\nContent: text: In physics, a gravitational field is a model used to explain the influences that a massive body extends into the space around itself, producing a force on another massive body. Thus, a gravitational field is used to explain gravitational phenomena, and is measured in newtons per kilogram (N/kg). Equivalently, it is measured in meters per second squared (m/s2). In its original concept, gravity was a force between point masses. Following Isaac Newton, Pierre-Simon Laplace attempted to model gravity as some kind of radiation field or fluid, and since the 19th century, explanations for gravity have usually been taught in terms of a field model, rather than a point attraction. In a field model, rather than two particles attracting each other, the particles distort spacetime via their mass, and this distortion is what is perceived and measured as a \"force\". In such a model one states that matter moves in certain ways in response to the curvature of spacetime, and that there is either no gravitational force, or that gravity is a fictitious force. Gravity is distinguished from other forces by its obedience to the equivalence principle. ==Classical mechanics== In classical mechanics, a gravitational field is a physical quantity. A gravitational field can be defined using Newton's law of universal gravitation. Determined in this way, the gravitational field around a single particle of mass is a vector field consisting at every point of a vector pointing directly towards the particle. The magnitude of the field at every point is calculated by applying the universal law, and represents the force per unit mass on any object at that point in space. Because the force field is conservative, there is a scalar potential energy per unit mass, , at each point in space associated with the force\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Center of mass\nContent: with density ρ(r) at each point r in the volume.

If the reference point R is chosen so that it is the center of mass, then \\iiint_{Q} \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\left(\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{R}\\right) dV = 0, which means the resultant torque . Because the resultant torque is zero the body will move as though it is a particle with its mass concentrated at the center of mass. By selecting the center of gravity as the reference point for a rigid body, the gravity forces will not cause the body to rotate, which means the weight of the body can be considered to be concentrated at the center of mass. ==Linear and angular momentum== The linear and angular momentum of a collection of particles can be simplified by measuring the\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Gravitational constant\nContent: text: The gravitational constant (also known as the universal gravitational constant, the Newtonian constant of gravitation, or the Cavendish gravitational constant), denoted by the capital letter , is an empirical physical constant involved in the calculation of gravitational effects in Sir Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation and in Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. In Newton's law, it is the proportionality constant connecting the gravitational force between two bodies with the product of their masses and the inverse square of their distance. In the Einstein field equations, it quantifies the relation between the geometry of spacetime and the energy-momentum tensor (also referred to as the stress–energy tensor). The measured value of the constant is known with some certainty to four significant digits. In SI units, its value is approximately The modern notation of Newton's law involving was introduced in the 1890s by C. V. Boys. The first implicit measurement with an accuracy within about 1% is attributed to Henry Cavendish in a 1798 experiment. ==Definition== According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, the magnitude of the attractive force () between two point-like bodies is directly proportional to the product of their masses, and , and inversely proportional to the square of the distance, , directed along the line connecting their centers of mass: F=G\\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}.

The term is gaining in importance due to the increased controversy over \"rights of cultural practice\", which are protected in many jurisdictions for indigenous peoples and sometimes ethnic minorities. It is also a major component of the field of cultural studies, and is a primary focus of international works such as the United Nations declaration of the rights of indigenous Peoples. Cultural practice is also a subject of discussion in questions of cultural survival. If an ethnic group retains its formal ethnic identity but loses its core cultural practices or the knowledge, resources, or ability to continue them, questions arise as to whether the culture is able to actually survive at all. International bodies such as the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues continually work on these issues, which are increasingly at the forefront of globalization questions. ==Examples== * Religious and spiritual practices * Medical treatment practices * Forms of artistic expression * Dietary preferences and culinary practices * Cultural institutions (see also Cultural Institutions Studies) * Natural resource management * Housing and construction * Childcare practices * Governance, leadership, conflict resolution * Power relationships * International cultural practices * \"Everyday life\" practices (including household relationships) ==Qualifications== The real question of what qualifies as a legitimate cultural practice is the subject of much legal and ethnic community debate. The question arises in controversial subject areas such as genital mutilation, indigenous hunting and gathering practices, and the question of licensing of traditional medical practitioners.

As one example of the application of Rozhdestvensly's theory to practical dilemmas of contemporary world, consider his study of the levels of morality. These levels are tribal (justifying murder for the sake of protection of kin or tribal territory), religious (where the murder of a non-relative is as condemned as the murder of a relative), professional (often involving exceptions to religious morality, e.g. artists who are required to prefer beauty over truth), and ecological (the level that presumes to overcome tribal, religious or professional allegiances for the sake of global well- being). Rozhdestvensky demonstrates how all of these levels co-exist and complement each other within individuals in the world \"struggling with globalist forces on the one hand and localist instincts on the other\" (Leach, Bridging Cultures, 2009). ===The Law of Non-Destruction and Accumulation of Culture=== In his Introduction to the Study of Culture Rozhdestvensky defines culture as events, facts and artifacts that are relevant for future generations because they provide rules, precedents and best practices. In that sense culture includes patterns of daily activity that constitute rules, and examples of human achievement that constitute precedents and best practices. New artifacts or events appear; they are accepted or ignored by users, and critiqued and evaluated by experts; then they are included in museum or other appropriate collections; they become systematized and codified. Then they become part of culture. The process of selection, description, codification is the process of formation of culture.

Whether a given group should assimilate is often disputed by both members of the group and others in society. Cultural assimilation does not guarantee social alikeness. Geographical and other natural barriers between cultures, even if created by the predominant culture, may be culturally different. Cultural assimilation can happen either spontaneously or forcibly, the latter when more dominant cultures use various means aimed at forced assimilation. Various types of assimilation, including forced cultural assimilation, are particularly relevant regarding Indigenous groups during colonialism taking place between the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. This type of assimilation included religious conversion, separation of families, changes of gender roles, division of property among foreign power, elimination of local economies, and lack of sustainable food supply. Whether via colonialism or within one nation, methods of forced assimilation are often unsustainable, leading to revolts and collapses of power to maintain control over cultural norms. Often, cultures that are forced into different cultural practices through forced cultural assimilation revert to their native practices and religions that differ from the forced cultural values of other dominant powers. In addition throughout history, voluntary assimilation is often in response to pressure from a more predominant culture, and conformity is a solution for people to remain in safety. An example of voluntary cultural assimilation would be during the Spanish Inquisition, when Jews and Muslims accepted the Roman Catholic Church as their religion, but meanwhile, many people still privately practised their traditional religions. That type of assimilation is used to convince a dominant power that a culture has peacefully assimilated yet often voluntary assimilation does not mean the group fully conforms to the accepted cultural beliefs. The term \"assimilation\" is often used about not\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Customization (anthropology)\nContent: attempt to create or maintain their lifestyle or to construct their identity. Instead of accepting a foreign object for what it is, the foreign object is incorporated and changed to fit one's lifestyle and choices. Take for example, the baseball cap. The producer of the baseball cap designed it to be worn with the bill facing forward, while the ‘customizer’ might have a different intended purpose. The 'customizer' might choose to change the orientation of the bill to meet a particular cultural aesthetic. Within this example, one sees that even products can be manipulated to serve individuals within the culture that the product is sold. Campbell argues that this is in an attempt to reinforce belonging within their culture. ==Customization and globalization== In the face of globalization, cultural practices are increasingly becoming more accessible and more people are being exposed to them. In this multicultural space, customization is helpful in maintaining one’s culture from afar. In his piece the “German Dual System”, Theodor Lewis argues that during this process a ‘decommodification’ occurs, where a commodity changes from being the “norm” to holding a personal value, often cultural. Lewis provides an example of customization. He examines the adaptation of human resource development models within the educational sector of less developed countries, documenting the various ways in which these countries adapt these models, whether they be imposed or taken on voluntarily. The goal behind their implementation is to stimulate “new growth and competitiveness in newly industrialized countries” (469 Lewis). Within his paper, he notes that the following methods of cultural exchange are used: * cultural borrowing * partial borrowing * pilot borrowing * customization * conceptual borrowing However, within the review, customization is found to be most effective. Lewis argues that customization allows each country to\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Cultural policy\nContent: developments in this field then become acknowledged as important forms of social innovation;\" However, they caution policy-makers that with glocalization, the rise of \"'big data' offers unprecedentedly powerful tools but also inevitably entails many risks for all kinds of artists (both musicians and their collaborators in other arts) as well as the sustainability of traditional cultural practices.\"Hebert, D. G. & Rykowski, M. (Eds.), Music Glocalization: Heritage and Innovation in a Digital Age (Cambridge Scholars, 2018), pp.367-368. ==Viewpoints== Such a public-cultural policy would remain faithful to the highest standards of excellence from a broad range of aesthetic expressions while providing the widest possible access to people from different geographic locales, socio-economic strata, and educational background, as Dr. Mulcahy said.Mulcahy, Kevin V. 1991. \"The Public Interest in Public Culture.\" Journal of Arts Management, Law and Society. 21: 5-25. In conceiving of public policy as an opportunity to provide alternatives not readily available in the marketplace, public cultural agencies would be better positioned to complement the efforts of the private sector rather than duplicate their activities. Similarly, cultural agencies can promote community development by supporting artistic heritages that are at a competitive disadvantage in a cultural world that is increasingly profit-driven. In sum, excellence should be viewed as the achievements of greatness from a horizontal, rather than a vertical, perspective and a cultural policy as supporting the totality of these varieties of excellence. These attitudes about a public cultural responsibility stand in marked contrast to much of the rest of the world, where culture is a question of historic patrimony, or the national identities of peoples, whether in independent states or regions within more powerful states. Inevitably, sensitive issues are involved in any discussion of culture as a public policy.\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Cultural retention\nContent: text: Cultural retention is the act of retaining the culture of a specific ethnic group of people, especially when there is reason to believe that the culture, through inaction, may be lost. Many African-American, European and Asian organizations have cultural retention programs in place. == Need == Cultural retention refers to the attempts made to preserve the cultural practices of a defined group, when many of their other forms and rituals have already been lost. This erosion is seen in minority groups feeling alienated from the dominant majority around them. They may strive to retain their traditional cultural practices because they give them joy and pride. This is also an attempt to prevent or reverse the effects of cultural erasure. Cultural erasure happens when cultural practices and customs are forgotten or abandoned by the community, as they adopt customs from the more dominant cultural group or more modernized practices. == Examples == People generally attempt to preserve their culture with social practices, ritual and festive events that usually mark the seasons, events in the agricultural calendar, or the stages of a person's life. Examples of this are worship rites, birth, wedding, funeral rites; relationship and kinship practices; traditional games and sports. Other facets of life, where cultural retention could be displayed are in everyday day to day life activities. Examples for this are seen in the music, dance, food (cooking practices and traditional recipes), clothing, art and craft, proverbs, special gestures, and modes of formal and informal greetings. *Accompong Maroons within Jamaica have tried to preserve their West African culture and avoid the European influences. *Cultural retention can be seen in some Caribbean rituals. E.g., jumping of the broom and throwing of rice during weddings, nine-night celebration before funeral service, carnival and new year\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Cultural Institutions Studies\nContent: formation. Monetary and non monetary value formation processes are mutually related to each other, often in a very tense relationship. Cultural goods with an exchange function must therefore be comprehensively analysed, taking into consideration all their multiple symbolic and economic, private and public, social and political functions. To sum up: The focus on cultural institutions sphere demands a synthesis of cultural, sociological, organizational, and economic methods of analysis and interpretation to create a multi-perspective approach to the relevant issues. However, culture and cultural practices are definitely not an object that may be observed and described from a distant, \"scientific\" point of view. Cultural issues are matters of public interest and are interwoven with personal and collective identities as well as with normative and political positions. Cultural Institutions Studies do not claim objectivity and a positivistic analysis. But it is a necessity to embark on a debate about presuppositions of research. This points to the critical philosophical roots of this approach.(Translation from German: Silvia Plaza, Vienna) == See also == * Art world * Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions * Creative Industries * Cultural industry * Culture industry * Cultural policy * Cultural Practice * Economics of the arts and literature * Goods * Non-profit sector * Sociology of culture * Value theory == Notes == ==References== *Zembylas, Tasos (2004): Kulturbetriebslehre.

Four examples of psychologists using their multicultural competencies are presented: === Four innovative programs === 1\\. Yup’ik Alaska native connections between the younger and older generations have declines, so psychologists developed an intervention called Gungasvik (translated to 'toolbox') where they teach the youth ancestral traditions. People in higher intensity condition of Gungasvik experienced more protection from suicide, and the youths reported higher levels of beliefs and experiences that made life enjoyable and meaningful. 2\\. Psychologists implemented CBT in the White Mountain Apache tribe, but tribal representatives felt like something could be added: spirituality should be a part of the treatment. After that, instead of triangular CBT Model (thinking, feeling, doing), the model became a rectangle of thoughts, feelings, behavior and spirituality. Tribal members who have suicidal thoughts can meet with community mental health specialist who use traditional spiritual prayers and songs combined with recovery efforts, and the older tribe members talk to children about tribal values and take them on field trips to sacred sites. Suicide deaths in the tribe dropped 38 percent from 2006 to 2012. 3\\. Nurses who were of Native American descent screened Cheyenne, Arapaho and other tribes for depression, alcohol misuse, tobacco use, etc and would see the clients that same day. There was a good response in the tribe because they found that the clients liked talking to centers mental health professional because they understood their traditions and heritage. Sharing cultural knowledge allowed for trust, and as patients felt better they spread the word to other tribes about their positive experience. 4\\.

However, in case the maximum is reached at many points, \\operatorname{argmax} needs to be considered a of points. For example :\\underset{x \\in [0, 4 \\pi]}{\\operatorname{arg\\,max}}\\, \\cos(x) = \\\\{ 0, 2 \\pi, 4 \\pi \\\\} because the maximum value of \\cos x is 1, which occurs on this interval for x = 0, 2 \\pi or 4 \\pi.

As another example, \\underset{x \\in \\mathbb{R}}{\\operatorname{arg\\,max}}\\, \\arctan(x) = \\varnothing, although \\arctan is bounded by \\pm\\pi/2.

If there are more numbers in this list, they must be at least 2+1 (approximately 10), because every intervening Fermat number is known to be composite. == In computing == The number 4,294,967,295, equivalent to the hexadecimal value , is the maximum value for a 32-bit unsigned integer in computing. It is therefore the maximum value for a variable declared as an unsigned integer (usually indicated by the codeword) in many programming languages running on modern computers. The presence of the value may reflect an error, overflow condition, or missing value. This value is also the largest memory address for CPUs using a 32-bit address bus. Being an odd value, its appearance may reflect an erroneous (misaligned) memory address. Such a value may also be used as a sentinel value to initialize newly allocated memory for debugging purposes. Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) uses a 32-bit addresses which limits the address space to (232) unique addresses. In 2004, 800 aircraft over Los Angeles were put in danger when the LA Air Route Traffic Control Center lost radio contact with all of the aircraft for about three hours, delaying 400 flights and cancelling 600, due to a computer design that kept time by starting at 4,294,967.295 seconds and counting down to zero, or 49 days, 17 hours, 2 minutes and 47.295 seconds.

The problem occurs in the design of video servers.Wil Michiels (2004). \"Performance Ratios for Differencing Methods\". Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, 2004. https://www.elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=8860464 This problem can be solved in polytime for k=2, but it is strongly NP-hard for k≥3. A variance of the differencing method can applied to this problem. == An exact algorithm == The complete Karmarkar–Karp algorithm (CKK) finds an optimal solution by constructing a tree of degree k!. * In the case k=2, each level corresponds to a pair of numbers, and the two branches correspond to taking their difference (i.e. putting them in different sets), or taking their sum (i.e. putting them in the same set). * For general k, each level corresponds to a pair of k-tuples, and each of the k! branches corresponds to a different way of combining the subsets in these tuples. For k=2, CKK runs substantially faster than the Complete Greedy Algorithm (CGA) on random instances. This is due to two reasons: when an equal partition does not exist, CKK often allows more trimming than CGA; and when an equal partition does exist, CKK often finds it much faster and thus allows earlier termination. Korf reports that CKK can optimally partition 40 15-digit double-precision numbers in about 3 hours, while CGA requires about 9 hours. In practice, with k=2, problems of arbitrary size can be solved by CKK if the numbers have at most 12 significant digits; with\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Quadruple-precision floating-point format\nContent: floating-point value.

This process is similar to performing long multiplication, but only having to perform the summation of some middle columns. While there are some carries that are not counted, computers usually perform arithmetic for many bits (32 or 64) and round, and we are only interested in the most significant digit(s). There is a possibility that a particular computation will be akin to failing to add a small number (e.g. 1) to the number 999999999999999, and that the error will propagate to the most significant digit. == BBP compared to other methods of computing == This algorithm computes without requiring custom data types having thousands or even millions of digits. The method calculates the nth digit without calculating the first n − 1 digits and can use small, efficient data types. Though the BBP formula can directly calculate the value of any given digit of with less computational effort than formulas that must calculate all intervening digits, BBP remains linearithmic (O(n \\log n)), whereby successively larger values of n require increasingly more time to calculate; that is, the \"further out\" a digit is, the longer it takes BBP to calculate it, just like the standard -computing algorithms. == Generalizations == D.

An example is the sodium-potassium metal alloy NaK. Other metal alloys that are liquid at room temperature include galinstan, which is a gallium-indium-tin alloy that melts at , as well as some amalgams (alloys involving mercury). Pure substances that are liquid under normal conditions include water, ethanol and many other organic solvents. Liquid water is of vital importance in chemistry and biology, and it is necessary for all known forms of life. Inorganic liquids include water, magma, inorganic nonaqueous solvents and many acids. Important everyday liquids include aqueous solutions like household bleach, other mixtures of different substances such as mineral oil and gasoline, emulsions like vinaigrette or mayonnaise, suspensions like blood, and colloids like paint and milk. Many gases can be liquefied by cooling, producing liquids such as liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen, liquid hydrogen and liquid helium. Not all gases can be liquified at atmospheric pressure, however. Carbon dioxide, for example, can only be liquified at pressures above 5.1 atm. Some materials cannot be classified within the classical three states of matter. For example, liquid crystals (used in liquid-crystal displays) possess both solid-like and liquid- like properties, and belong to their own state of matter distinct from either liquid or solid. ==Applications== === Lubrication === Liquids are useful as lubricants due to their ability to form a thin, freely flowing layer between solid materials. Lubricants such as oil are chosen for viscosity and flow characteristics that are suitable throughout the operating temperature range of the component. Oils are often used in\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Liquid\nContent: allowing a liquid to flow while a solid remains rigid. A liquid, like a gas, displays the properties of a fluid. A liquid can flow, assume the shape of a container, and, if placed in a sealed container, will distribute applied pressure evenly to every surface in the container. If liquid is placed in a bag, it can be squeezed into any shape. Unlike a gas, a liquid is nearly incompressible, meaning that it occupies nearly a constant volume over a wide range of pressures; it does not generally expand to fill available space in a container but forms its own surface, and it may not always mix readily with another liquid. These properties make a liquid suitable for applications such as hydraulics. Liquid particles are bound firmly but not rigidly. They are able to move around one another freely, resulting in a limited degree of particle mobility. As the temperature increases, the increased vibrations of the molecules causes distances between the molecules to increase. When a liquid reaches its boiling point, the cohesive forces that bind the molecules closely together break, and the liquid changes to its gaseous state (unless superheating occurs). If the temperature is decreased, the distances between the molecules become smaller. When the liquid reaches its freezing point the molecules will usually lock into a very specific order, called crystallizing, and the bonds between them become more rigid, changing the liquid into its solid state (unless supercooling occurs). ==Examples== Only two elements are liquid at standard conditions for temperature and pressure: mercury and bromine. Four more elements have melting points slightly above room temperature: francium, caesium, gallium and rubidium.Theodore Gray, The Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe New York: Workman Publishing, 2009 p. 127\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Two-phase flow\nContent: fluid being pumped. If pressure drops further, which can happen locally near the vanes for the pump, for example, then a phase change can occur and gas will be present in the pump. Similar effects can also occur on marine propellers; wherever it occurs, it is a serious problem for designers. When the vapor bubble collapses, it can produce very large pressure spikes, which over time will cause damage on the propeller or turbine. The above two-phase flow cases are for a single fluid occurring by itself as two different phases, such as steam and water. The term 'two-phase flow' is also applied to mixtures of different fluids having different phases, such as air and water, or oil and natural gas. Sometimes even three-phase flow is considered, such as in oil and gas pipelines where there might be a significant fraction of solids. Although oil and water are not strictly distinct phases (since they are both liquids) they are sometimes considered as a two-phase flow; and the combination of oil, gas and water (e.g. the flow from an offshore oil well) may also be considered a three-phase flow. Other interesting areas where two-phase flow is studied includes water electrolysis, climate systems such as clouds, and in groundwater flow, in which the movement of water and air through the soil is studied. Other examples of two-phase flow include bubbles, rain, waves on the sea, foam, fountains, mousse, cryogenics, and oil slicks. One final example is in the electrical explosion of metal. == Characteristics of two-phase flow == Several features make two-phase flow an interesting and challenging branch of fluid mechanics: *Surface tension makes all dynamical problems nonlinear (see Weber number) *In the case of air and water at standard temperature and pressure,\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Liquid\nContent: viscosity is independent of time, shear rate, or shear-rate history. Examples of Newtonian liquids include water, glycerin, motor oil, honey, or mercury. A non-Newtonian liquid is one where the viscosity is not independent of these factors and either thickens (increases in viscosity) or thins (decreases in viscosity) under shear. Examples of non-Newtonian liquids include ketchup, custard, or starch solutions.Honey in Traditional and Modern Medicine by Laid Boukraa -- CRC Press 2014 Page 22--24 ===Elasticity under confinement=== Confined liquids may exhibit different mechanical properties compared to bulk liquids. For example, liquids under sub-millimeter confinement (e.g. in the gap between rigid walls) exhibit a solid-like mechanical response and possess a surprisingly large low-frequency elastic shear modulus, which scales with the inverse cubic power of the confinement length. ===Sound propagation=== The speed of sound in a liquid is given by c = \\sqrt {K/\\rho} where K is the bulk modulus of the liquid and \\rho the density. As an example, water has a bulk modulus of about 2.2 GPa and a density of 1000 kg/m3, which gives c = 1.5 km/s. ==Thermodynamics== ===Phase transitions=== At a temperature below the boiling point, any matter in liquid form will evaporate until reaching equilibrium with the reverse process of condensation of its vapor. At this point the vapor will condense at the same rate as the liquid evaporates. Thus, a liquid cannot exist permanently if the evaporated liquid is continually removed. A liquid at or above its boiling point will normally boil, though superheating can prevent this in certain circumstances. At a temperature below the freezing point, a liquid will tend to crystallize, changing to its solid form. Unlike the transition to gas, there\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Liquid\nContent: to its solid form. Unlike the transition to gas, there is no equilibrium at this transition under constant pressure, so unless supercooling occurs, the liquid will eventually completely crystallize. However, this is only true under constant pressure, so that (for example) water and ice in a closed, strong container might reach an equilibrium where both phases coexist. For the opposite transition from solid to liquid, see melting. ===Liquids in space=== The phase diagram explains why liquids do not exist in space or any other vacuum. Since the pressure is zero (except on surfaces or interiors of planets and moons) water and other liquids exposed to space will either immediately boil or freeze depending on the temperature. In regions of space near the earth, water will freeze if the sun is not shining directly on it and vaporize (sublime) as soon as it is in sunlight. If water exists as ice on the moon, it can only exist in shadowed holes where the sun never shines and where the surrounding rock does not heat it up too much. At some point near the orbit of Saturn, the light from the sun is too faint to sublime ice to water vapor. This is evident from the longevity of the ice that composes Saturn's rings. ===Solutions=== Liquids can form solutions with gases, solids, and other liquids. Two liquids are said to be miscible if they can form a solution in any proportion; otherwise they are immiscible. As an example, water and ethanol (drinking alcohol) are miscible whereas water and gasoline are immiscible.Silberberg, pp. 188 and 502 In some cases a mixture of otherwise immiscible liquids can be stabilized to form an emulsion, where one liquid is dispersed throughout the other as microscopic droplets. Usually\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Fluid\nContent: or they require a certain initial stress before they deform (see plasticity). Solids respond with restoring forces to both shear stresses and to normal stresses—both compressive and tensile. In contrast, ideal fluids only respond with restoring forces to normal stresses, called pressure: fluids can be subjected to both compressive stress, corresponding to positive pressure, and to tensile stress, corresponding to negative pressure. Both solids and liquids also have tensile strengths, which when exceeded in solids makes irreversible deformation and fracture, and in liquids causes the onset of cavitation. Both solids and liquids have free surfaces, which cost some amount of free energy to form. In the case of solids, the amount of free energy to form a given unit of surface area is called surface energy, whereas for liquids the same quantity is called surface tension. The ability of liquids to flow results in different behaviour in response to surface tension than in solids, although in equilibrium both will try to minimise their surface energy: liquids tend to form rounded droplets, whereas pure solids tend to form crystals. Gases do not have free surfaces, and freely diffuse. ==Modelling== In a solid, shear stress is a function of strain, but in a fluid, shear stress is a function of strain rate. A consequence of this behavior is Pascal's law which describes the role of pressure in characterizing a fluid's state. The behavior of fluids can be described by the Navier–Stokes equations—a set of partial differential equations which are based on: * continuity (conservation of mass), * conservation of linear momentum, * conservation of angular momentum, * conservation of energy. The study of fluids is fluid mechanics, which is subdivided into fluid dynamics and fluid statics depending on whether the fluid is in motion. ===Classification\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Liquid\nContent: text: A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a nearly constant volume independent of pressure. It is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. The density of a liquid is usually close to that of a solid, and much higher than that of a gas. Therefore, liquid and solid are both termed condensed matter. On the other hand, as liquids and gases share the ability to flow, they are both called fluids. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds. Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container. Unlike a gas, a liquid maintains a fairly constant density and does not disperse to fill every space of a container. Although liquid water is abundant on Earth, this state of matter is actually the least common in the known universe, because liquids require a relatively narrow temperature/pressure range to exist. Most known matter in the universe is either gas (as interstellar clouds) or plasma (as stars). ==Introduction== thumb|Thermal image of a sink full of hot water with cold water being added, showing how the hot and the cold water flow into each other. Liquid is one of the four primary states of matter, with the others being solid, gas and plasma. A liquid is a fluid. Unlike a solid, the molecules in a liquid have a much greater freedom to move. The forces that bind the molecules together in a solid are only temporary in a liquid, allowing a liquid to flow while a solid remains rigid.\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Liquid\nContent: k_{\\text{B}} T} \\right)^{1/2} is small compared with the length scale under consideration. Here, \\hbar is the Planck constant and m is the molecule's mass. Typical values of \\Lambda are about 0.01-0.1 nanometers (Table 1). Hence, a high-resolution model of liquid structure at the nanoscale may require quantum mechanical considerations. A notable example is hydrogen bonding in associated liquids like water, where, due to the small mass of the proton, inherently quantum effects such as zero-point motion and tunneling are important. For a liquid to behave classically at the macroscopic level, \\Lambda must be small compared with the average distance a \\approx \\rho^{-1/3} between molecules. That is, : \\frac{\\Lambda}{a} \\ll 1 Representative values of this ratio for a few liquids are given in Table 1. The conclusion is that quantum effects are important for liquids at low temperatures and with small molecular mass. For dynamic processes, there is an additional timescale constraint: : \\tau \\gg \\frac{h}{k_B T} where \\tau is the timescale of the process under consideration. For room-temperature liquids, the right-hand side is about 10−14 seconds, which generally means that time- dependent processes involving translational motion can be described classically. At extremely low temperatures, even the macroscopic behavior of certain liquids deviates from classical mechanics. Notable examples are hydrogen and helium. Due to their low temperature and mass, such liquids have a thermal de Broglie wavelength comparable to the average distance between molecules. === Dynamic phenomena === The expression for the sound velocity of a liquid, : c = \\sqrt {K/\\rho} , contains the bulk modulus K. If K is frequency-independent, then the liquid behaves as a linear medium, so that sound propagates without dissipation or mode coupling.\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Give two examples of a liquid.\n\n[/INST]IDs: 0, 1, 4</s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

The molecule is a diamine, consisting of a hexamethylene hydrocarbon chain terminated with amine functional groups. The colorless solid (yellowish for some commercial samples) has a strong amine odor. About 1 billion kilograms are produced annually.Robert A. Smiley \"Hexamethylenediamine\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. ==Synthesis== Hexamethylenediamine was first reported by Theodor Curtius.Curtius, Theodor and Clemm, Hans (1900) \"Synthese des 1,3-Diaminopropans und 1,6-Diaminohexans aus Glutarsäure resp. Korksäure\" (Synthesis of 1,3-diaminopropane and 1,6-diaminohexane from glutaric acid and suberic acid, respectively), Journal für praktische Chemie, 2nd series, 62 : 189–211. It is produced by the hydrogenation of adiponitrile: :NC(CH2)4CN + 4 H2 → H2N(CH2)6NH2 The hydrogenation is conducted on molten adiponitrile diluted with ammonia, typical catalysts being based on cobalt and iron. The yield is good, but commercially significant side products are generated by virtue of reactivity of partially hydrogenated intermediates. These other products include 1,2-diaminocyclohexane, hexamethyleneimine, and the triamine bis(hexamethylenetriamine). An alternative process uses Raney nickel as the catalyst and adiponitrile that is diluted with hexamethylenediamine itself (as the solvent). This process operates without ammonia and at lower pressure and temperature. ==Applications== Hexamethylenediamine is used almost exclusively for the production of polymers, an application that takes advantage of its structure. It is difunctional in terms of the amine groups and tetra functional with respect to the amine hydrogens. The great majority of the diamine is consumed by the production of nylon 66 via condensation with adipic acid. Otherwise hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) is generated from\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Direct process\nContent: units. Transfer of a second chloromethane allows for the release of the Me2SiCl2. Thus, copper is oxidized from the zero oxidation state and then reduced to regenerate the catalyst. The chain reaction can be terminated in many ways. These termination processes give rise to the other products that are seen in the reaction. For example, combining two Si-Cl groups gives the SiCl2 group, which undergoes Cu-catalyzed reaction with MeCl to give MeSiCl3. In addition to copper, the catalyst optimally contains promoter metals that facilitate the reaction. Among the many promoter metals, zinc, tin, antimony, magnesium, calcium, bismuth, arsenic, and cadmium have been mentioned. ==Product distribution and isolation== The major product for the direct process should be dichlorodimethylsilane, Me2SiCl2. However, many other products are formed. Unlike most reactions, this distribution is actually desirable because the product isolation is very efficient. Each methylchlorosilane has specific and often substantial applications. Me2SiCl2 is the most useful. It is the precursor for the majority of silicon products produced on an industrial scale. The other products are used in the preparation of siloxane polymers as well as specialized applications. Dichlorodimethylsilane is the major product of the reaction, as is expected, being obtained in about 70–90% yield. The next most abundant product is methyltrichlorosilane (MeSiCl3), at 5–15% of the total. Other products include Me3SiCl (2–4%), MeHSiCl2 (1–4%), and Me2HSiCl (0.1–0.5%). The Me2SiCl2 is purified by fractional distillation. Although the boiling points of the various chloromethylsilanes are similar (Me2SiCl2: 70°C, MeSiCl3: 66°C, Me3SiCl: 57°C, MeHSiCl2: 41°C, Me2HSiCl: 35°C), the distillation utilizes columns with high separating capacities, connected in series.

Videos can be downloaded at == Production == === Biological processes === Carbon dioxide is a by-product of the fermentation of sugar in the brewing of beer, whisky and other alcoholic beverages and in the production of bioethanol. Yeast metabolizes sugar to produce and ethanol, also known as alcohol, as follows: : C6H12O6 -> 2 CO2 + 2 C2H5OH All aerobic organisms produce when they oxidize carbohydrates, fatty acids, and proteins. The large number of reactions involved are exceedingly complex and not described easily. Refer to (cellular respiration, anaerobic respiration and photosynthesis). The equation for the respiration of glucose and other monosaccharides is: : C6H12O6 + 6 O2 -> 6 CO2 + 6 H2O Anaerobic organisms decompose organic material producing methane and carbon dioxide together with traces of other compounds. Regardless of the type of organic material, the production of gases follows well defined kinetic pattern. Carbon dioxide comprises about 40–45% of the gas that emanates from decomposition in landfills (termed \"landfill gas\"). Most of the remaining 50–55% is methane. === Industrial processes === Carbon dioxide can be obtained by distillation from air, but the method is inefficient. Industrially, carbon dioxide is predominantly an unrecovered waste product, produced by several methods which may be practiced at various scales. ==== Combustion ==== The combustion of all carbon-based fuels, such as methane (natural gas), petroleum distillates (gasoline, diesel, kerosene, propane), coal, wood and generic organic matter produces carbon dioxide and, except in the case of pure carbon, water.

It is a white solid that is soluble in organic solvents. Benzophenone is a widely used building block in organic chemistry, being the parent diarylketone. ==Uses== Benzophenone can be used as a photo initiator in UV(Ultra-violet)-curing applications such as inks, imaging, and clear coatings in the printing industry. Benzophenone prevents ultraviolet (UV) light from damaging scents and colors in products such as perfumes and soaps. Benzophenone can also be added to plastic packaging as a UV blocker to prevent photo-degradation of the packaging polymers or its contents. Its use allows manufacturers to package the product in clear glass or plastic (such as a PETE water bottle). Without it, opaque or dark packaging would be required. In biological applications, benzophenones have been used extensively as photophysical probes to identify and map peptide–protein interactions. Benzophenone is used as an additive in flavorings or perfumes for \"sweet- woody-geranium-like notes.\" ==Synthesis== Benzophenone is produced by the copper-catalyzed oxidation of diphenylmethane with air. A laboratory route involves the reaction of benzene with carbon tetrachloride followed by hydrolysis of the resulting diphenyldichloromethane. It can also be prepared by Friedel–Crafts acylation of benzene with benzoyl chloride in the presence of a Lewis acid (e.g. aluminium chloride) catalyst: since benzoyl chloride can itself be produced by the reaction of benzene with phosgene the first synthesis proceeded directly from those materials. Another route of synthesis is through a palladium(II)/oxometalate catalyst. This converts an alcohol to a ketone with two groups on each side. Another, less well-known reaction to produce benzophenone is the pyrolysis of anhydrous calcium benzoate. ==Organic chemistry==\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Citric acid cycle\nContent: GTP (or ATP), and as electrons in NADH and QH2. The NADH generated in the citric acid cycle may later be oxidized (donate its electrons) to drive ATP synthesis in a type of process called oxidative phosphorylation. FADH2 is covalently attached to succinate dehydrogenase, an enzyme which functions both in the CAC and the mitochondrial electron transport chain in oxidative phosphorylation. FADH2, therefore, facilitates transfer of electrons to coenzyme Q, which is the final electron acceptor of the reaction catalyzed by the succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex, also acting as an intermediate in the electron transport chain. Mitochondria in animals, including humans, possess two succinyl-CoA synthetases: one that produces GTP from GDP, and another that produces ATP from ADP. Plants have the type that produces ATP (ADP-forming succinyl-CoA synthetase). Several of the enzymes in the cycle may be loosely associated in a multienzyme protein complex within the mitochondrial matrix. The GTP that is formed by GDP-forming succinyl-CoA synthetase may be utilized by nucleoside-diphosphate kinase to form ATP (the catalyzed reaction is GTP + ADP → GDP + ATP). == Products == Products of the first turn of the cycle are one GTP (or ATP), three NADH, one FADH2 and two CO2.{cn}} Because two acetyl-CoA molecules are produced from each glucose molecule, two cycles are required per glucose molecule. Therefore, at the end of two cycles, the products are: two GTP, six NADH, two FADH2, and four CO2.

Tetrahydro-2-furoic acid has been prepared via selective hydrogenation of 2-furoic acid over a bimetallic catalyst of palladium-nickel supported on alumina. Enantioselective heterogeneous hydrogenation of furoic acid to chiral tetrahydro-2-furoic acid proceeds in the presence of cinchonidine-modified alumina supported palladium catalyst in 95% yield and 32% enantiomeric excess. Similarly, homogeneous hydrogenation to chiral tetrahydro-2-furoic acid proceeds quantitatively with 24-27% enantiomeric excess in methanol solution employing a chiral, ferrocene-phosphine catalyst. == Applications == ===Pharmaceuticals=== Reaction of tetrahydro-2-furoic acid with the hydrochloride salt of 3-[(4-amino-6,7-dimethoxy-2-quinazolinyl)methylamino]-propanenitrile provided alfuzosin, a drug for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).Uday Rajaram Bapat , Jose Paul Potams, Narasimhan Subramanian and Jon Valgeirsson, \"Process for the preparation of alfuzosin and salts thereof \", PCT Int.

Then, the intermediate is decarboxylated, yielding a 1,2-enediol of ribulose 5-phosphate, which tautomerizes to form ribulose 5-phosphate. High levels of NADPH are believed to inhibit the enzyme, while 6-phosphogluconate acts to activate the enzyme. ==Biological Function== 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase is involved in the production of ribulose 5-phosphate, which is used in nucleotide synthesis, and functions in the pentose phosphate pathway as the main generator of cellular NADPH. ==Disease Relevance== Since NADPH is required by both thioredoxin reductase and glutathione reductase to reduce oxidized thioredoxin and glutathionine, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase is believed to be involved in protecting cells from oxidative damage. Several studies have linked oxidative stress to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, as well as cancer, These studies have found phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity to be up-regulated, both in tumor cells and in relevant cortical regions of Alzheimer's patient brains, most likely as a compensatory reaction to highly oxidative environments. Recently, phosphogluconate dehydrogenase has been posited as a potential drug target for African sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis). The pentose phosphate pathway protects the trypanosomes from oxidative stress via the generation of NADPH and provides carbohydrate intermediates used in nucleotide synthesis. Structural differences between mammalian and trypanosome 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase have allowed for the development of selective inhibitors of the enzyme. Phosphorylated carbohydrate substrate and transition state analogues, non-carbohydrate substrate analogues and triphenylmethane-based compounds are currently being explored. ==References== * * * * Category:EC 1.1.1 Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes Category:Manganese enzymes Category:Enzymes of\n\nID: 7\nTitle: 6-phosphogluconolactonase\nContent: also occurs between the product carboxylate and backbone amines of surrounding glycine residues. none|thumb|711x711px|Proposed mechanism of 6-phosphogluconolactone hydrolysis by 6PGL. == Enzyme Structure == 6PGL in Homo sapiens exists as a monomer at cytosolic physiological conditions, and is composed of 258 amino acid residues with a total molecular mass of ~30 kDa. The tertiary structure of the enzyme utilizes an α/β hydrolase fold, with both parallel and anti-parallel β-sheets surrounded by eight α-helices and five 310 helices. Stability of the tertiary structure of the protein is reinforced through salt bridges between aspartic acid and arginine residues, and from aromatic side-chain stacking interactions. 6PGL isolated from Trypanosoma brucei was found to bind with a Zn2+ ion in a non-catalytic role, but this has not been observed in other organisms, including Thermotoga maritima and Vibrio cholerae. == Biological Function == 6-phosphogluconolactonase catalyzes the conversion of 6-phosphogluconolactone to 6-phosphogluconic acid, both intermediates in the oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway, in which glucose is converted into ribulose 5-phosphate.

The plant is called skunk cabbage because of the distinctive \"skunky\" odor that it emits when it blooms. This odor will permeate the area where the plant grows, and can be detected even in old, dried specimens. The distinctive odor attracts its pollinators, scavenging flies and beetles. Although similarly named and with a similar smell, the plant is easy to distinguish from the eastern skunk cabbage (Symplocarpus foetidus), another species in the arum family found in eastern North America. A cross between it and a closely related species from Japan, also called \"skunk cabbage\" but less malodorous, is grown as an ornamental plant on the margins of British aquatic gardens. ==Description== thumb|upright|Flower detail right|thumb|Foliage of L. americanus The plant grows from rhizomes that measure or longer, and in diameter. The short-stalked leaves are the largest of any native plant in the region, long and wide when mature. Its flowers are produced in a spadix contained within a large, bright yellow or yellowish green spathe atop a stalk. The flowers are numerous and densely packed. It is among the first flowers to bloom in late winter or early spring (typically March–July).

Bruised leaves present an odor reminiscent of skunk. Symplocarpus combines the Greek word symploce, meaning \"connection\" and carpos, meaning \"fruit\", to indicate that the plant has a compound fruit. Linnaeus gave the plant its species name of foetidus, Latin for \"bad-smelling\". The plant produces a strong odor, which is repulsive to many but sometimes described as smelling like \"fresh cabbage with a slight suggestion of mustard\". The odor increases in intensity over time, as the plant matures, likely due to increased ripeness in the plant's stamens. == Description == The plant grows from a thick rhizome, typically measuring 30 cm (1 ft). It has leaves that are large, each long and wide. Blooming early in the spring, just its blossoms can be seen above the mud. The plant is generally pulled back into the earth as it develops every year. The roots permanently wrinkle up due to their contractile activity. Particularly towards the top or older end of older roots, these marks or wrinkles have an odd ring-like appearance. As time elapses the entire stem is buried below ground and the plant becomes practically impossible to dig up. The spathe, which is 10–15 cm (4–6 in) tall and comes in a variety of colours, contains a spadix that is 5–10 cm (2–4 in) long in which the flowers reside. While older spathes develop a darker general color with purple smears, younger spathes have a yellowish-green color. Due to\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Symplocarpus foetidus\nContent: an endangered species. Its habitats include moist regions including marshes, wet forests, and stream banks. Like others in the arum family, the eastern skunk cabbage grows best in areas with great moisture. ==Ecology== Eastern skunk cabbage belongs to a select group of thermogenic plants for its capacity to create temperatures of up to above air temperature through cyanide-resistant cellular respiration (via alternative oxidase) in order to melt its way through frozen ground. One mechanism behind maintaining heat around the plant is the thermogenic oscillation of the spadix: independent of light, a precise thermal regulator is produced by an oscillatory temperature-sensing model in the spadix under dynamic external temperature variation. An equilibrium between heat production and loss, due to heat radiation, evaporation, conduction and convention, is maintained in the spadix. Additionally, the airflow around the spathe effiectively maintains heat generated by the spadix. Eastern skunk cabbage blooms while there is snow and ice on the ground, yet early insects that also emerge at this time effectively pollinate it. According to certain research, the heat the plant generates may aid in dispersing its odour in the atmosphere in addition to enabling the plant to flourish in cold environments. Skunk cabbage plants generate skunk-like floral odours that contain dimethyl disulfide, aliphatic hydrocarbons, carboxylic acids, and esters, whereas only female plants produce aromatic hydrocarbons and indole chemicals. The fact that the spathe is warmer than the surrounding air may induce carrion-feeding insects to enter it more than once, promoting pollination. Calliphora vomitoria and other blowflies are common pollinators of skunk cabbage. Curiously, spiders' webs were frequently noticed at the entrance to the spathes. The flower's carrion-like odor attracts the flies, which become tangled in the spider's\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Lysichiton camtschatcensis\nContent: text: thumb|Lysichiton camtschatcensis in Yamagata, Japan Lysichiton camtschatcensis, common name Asian skunk cabbage, white skunk cabbage, Far Eastern swamp lantern or Japanese swamp lantern, is a plant found in swamps and wet woods, along streams and in other wet areas of the Kamchatka Peninsula, the Kuril Islands, Sakhalin and northern Japan. The common name \"skunk cabbage\" is used for the genus Lysichiton, which includes L. americanus, the western skunk cabbage, noted for its unpleasant smell. The Asian skunk cabbage is more variable: plants have been reported in different cases to smell disgusting, not at all, and sweet. In Japanese it is known as mizubashō (lit. \"water-banana\") from a supposed similarity to the Japanese banana, a name with poetic rather than malodorous associations.As described for example in photo handbook , p. 666 It is not closely related to the true cabbage. ==Description== It is a robust herbaceous perennial growing to tall and wide, with strongly veined, glossy leaves long.

The plant was mainly utilised for its antispasmodic and expectorant qualities, which are still used in contemporary herbalism. In particular, the Winnebago and Dakota tribes utilised it to encourage phlegm evacuation in asthma patients. Different cultures also utilised it as a talisman and seasoning. It was employed as the medicine \"dracontium\" in pharmaceutical goods from 1820 until 1882 to treat respiratory conditions, neurological disorders, rheumatism, and dropsy. Internal administration of the plant's rootstock can be used to treat a variety of respiratory and nervous conditions, including hay fever, asthma, whooping cough, catarrh, and bronchitis. Young leaves that have been completely dried are particularly useful when reintroduced in soups or stews. ==Toxicity== Since its roots are antispasmodic, diaphoretic, diuretic, emetic, expectorant, and slightly narcotic, it is not recommended to directly consume the raw plant. While high quantities of the root can produce nausea and vomiting, headaches, and dizziness, handling the fresh leaves can burn skin. Other symptoms of poisoning include swelling of the lip, throat, and tongue. This is due to calcium oxalate crystals, which are moderately harmful to humans. It is possible to eliminate the toxicity with care, such as changing the water frequently when boiling the leaves, or thoroughly drying the plant. ==Gallery== File:앉은부채.jpg|Eastern skunk cabbage melting a hole through snow.

A simple divide-and-conquer algorithm is more effective asymptotically: given a binary number, it is divided by 10k, where k is chosen so that the quotient roughly equals the remainder; then each of these pieces is converted to decimal and the two are concatenated. Given a decimal number, it can be split into two pieces of about the same size, each of which is converted to binary, whereupon the first converted piece is multiplied by 10k and added to the second converted piece, where k is the number of decimal digits in the second, least-significant piece before conversion. ===Hexadecimal=== Binary may be converted to and from hexadecimal more easily. This is because the radix of the hexadecimal system (16) is a power of the radix of the binary system (2). More specifically, 16 = 24, so it takes four digits of binary to represent one digit of hexadecimal, as shown in the adjacent table. To convert a hexadecimal number into its binary equivalent, simply substitute the corresponding binary digits: :3A16 = 0011 10102 :E716 = 1110 01112 To convert a binary number into its hexadecimal equivalent, divide it into groups of four bits. If the number of bits isn't a multiple of four, simply insert extra 0 bits at the left (called padding). For example: :10100102 = 0101 0010 grouped with padding = 5216 :110111012 = 1101 1101 grouped = DD16 To convert a hexadecimal number into its decimal equivalent, multiply the decimal equivalent of each hexadecimal digit by the corresponding power of 16 and add the resulting values: :C0E716 = (12 × 163) + (0 × 162)\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Numeric precision in Microsoft Excel\nContent: In the third example, is a more complicated binary number, (15 bits altogether).

Similar is done by other spreadsheets, the handling of the different amount of decimal digits which can be exactly stored in the 53 bit mantissa of a 'double' (e.g. 16 digits between 1 and 8, but only 15 between and 1 and between 8 and 10) is somewhat difficult and solved 'suboptimal'.

Some deserts do not have rainfall all year round, they are located far from the ocean. High-pressure cells and high temperatures can also increase the level of aridity. === Wind === Wind greatly contributes to aridity in tropical deserts. If wind speed exceeds 80 km/h, it can generate dust storms and sandstorms and erode the rocky surface. Therefore, wind plays an important role in shaping various landforms. This phenomenon is known as the eolian process. There are two types of eolian process: deflation and abrasion. First, deflation may cause the light lowering of ground surface, leading to deflation hollows, plains, basins, blowouts, wind-eroded plains and parabolic dunes. Second, the eolian process leads to abrasion, which forms special landforms with a significant undercut. === Landforms === Various landforms are found in tropical deserts due to different kinds of eolian process. The major landforms are dunes, depressions and pans, yardangs, and inverted topography. ==== Dunes ==== thumb|Dunes|270x270px There are various kinds of dune in tropical deserts. Representative dunes include dome dunes, transverse dunes, barchans, star dunes, shadow dunes, linear dunes and longitudinal dunes. ==== Depression ==== A desert depression is caused by polygenetic factors such as wind erosion, broad shallow warping and block faulting, stream erosion, karst activity, salt weathering mass wasting, and zoogenic processes; representative examples are the large enclosed basins in Africa, such as Farafra, Baharia, Dakhla, Qattara, Siwa and Kargha. ==== Pans ==== Pans are widespread in southern and western Australia, southern Africa and the high plains of the United States deserts. The factors responsible for pans include a vegetation- free surface and low humidity, a low water table and poorly consolidated\n\nID: 1\nTitle: High Atlas\nContent: Agdal (garden in Berber). This technique has intrigued many Western agriculturalists, in which they were impressed by the high efficiency of this agricultural system. Many scientists, particularly French scientists, make yearly expeditions to observe the community and their living system. == Climate == thumb|High Atlas There are two types of Alpine Climates in the High Atlas: * Oceanic climate, dominates the north and south of the Western High Atlas until (Jbel Toubkal), as well as the northern part of Central High Atlas from Jbel Toubkal until Imilchil, owing to their exposition to the perturbations coming from the North Atlantic Ocean. These regions are relatively humid with irregular precipitations but occasionally torrential. The annual rainfall is between . The drought in the summer months, interrupted by thunderstorms, is usually intense. Snow falls between November and April, but can persist from September to June in the peaks. Important rivers flow through the valleys (including Asif Melloul, Oued n'Fis, and Oued Tessaout) supply the fertile basins like Aït Bou Guemez and Imilchil. These conditions allow the existence of pine, oak and cedar forests. However, these forests are declining because of the reducing of annual precipitation, over-exploitation of the trees (used for construction and heating), and sheep-goat overgrazing. * Continental semi-arid or steppe climate, and is present in the southern part of the Central High Atlas, from Toubkal to Imilchil, and the whole Oriental High-Atlas down of Imilchil. These regions are marked by variations in temperatures. It extends southward from the steppe lands into rocky desert. In addition, some localized valleys supplied by irrigation make agriculture possible. Forests are almost rare. This portion of High-Atlas is very similar to the Rocky Mountains in the western United States. == Subdivisions ==\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Trewartha climate classification\nContent: classified Aw if the dry season is at the time of low sun/short days or As if the dry season is at the time of high sun/long days. There was no specific monsoon climate identifier in the original scheme, but Am was added later, with the same parameters as Köppen's (except that at least three months, rather than one, must have less than 60 mm average precipitation). ===Group B: Dry (arid and semi-arid) climates=== BW and BS mean the same as in the Köppen scheme. However, a different formula is used to quantify the aridity threshold: 10(T − 10) + 3P, with T equaling the mean annual temperature in degrees Celsius and P denoting the percentage of total precipitation received in the six high-sun months (April through September in the Northern Hemisphere and October through March in the Southern).Patton CP (1962) A note on the classification of dry climate in the Köppen system. California Geographer 3: 105–112 If the precipitation for a given location is less than the above formula, its climate is said to be that of a desert (BW); if it is equal to or greater than the above formula but less than twice that amount, the climate is classified as steppe (BS); and if the precipitation is more than double the value of the formula the climate is not in Group B. Unlike in Köppen's scheme, no thermal subsets exist within this group in Trewartha's, unless the Universal Thermal Scale (see below) is used. ===Group C: Subtropical climates=== In the Trewartha scheme the \"C\" climate group encompasses Subtropical climates that have 8 or more months with a mean temperature of or higher.

In a continuous landscape, such as a forest giving way to open woodland, the exact edge location is fuzzy and is sometimes determined by a local gradient exceeding a threshold, such as the point where the tree cover falls below thirty-five percent. === Ecotones, ecoclines, and ecotopes === A type of boundary is the ecotone, or the transitional zone between two communities. Ecotones can arise naturally, such as a lakeshore, or can be human-created, such as a cleared agricultural field from a forest. The ecotonal community retains characteristics of each bordering community and often contains species not found in the adjacent communities. Classic examples of ecotones include fencerows, forest to marshlands transitions, forest to grassland transitions, or land-water interfaces such as riparian zones in forests. Characteristics of ecotones include vegetational sharpness, physiognomic change, occurrence of a spatial community mosaic, many exotic species, ecotonal species, spatial mass effect, and species richness higher or lower than either side of the ecotone. An ecocline is another type of landscape boundary, but it is a gradual and continuous change in environmental conditions of an ecosystem or community. Ecoclines help explain the distribution and diversity of organisms within a landscape because certain organisms survive better under certain conditions, which change along the ecocline. They contain heterogeneous communities which are considered more environmentally stable than those of ecotones. An ecotope is a spatial term representing the smallest ecologically distinct unit in mapping and classification of landscapes. Relatively homogeneous, they are spatially explicit landscape units used to stratify landscapes into ecologically distinct features. They are useful for the measurement and mapping of landscape structure, function, and change\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Name two types of desert biomes.\n\n[/INST]IDs: 0</s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

For example, this sentence using active voice: (Note: the first line is in Traditional Chinese while the second is Simplified Chinese) corresponds to the following sentence using passive voice. Note that the agent phrase is optional. In addition, through the addition of the auxiliary verb \"to be\" (shì) the passive voice is frequently used to emphasize the identity of the actor. This example places emphasis on the dog, presumably as opposed to some other animal: Mandarin also has an object- retaining passive which contains both the object and the topic (mostly the possessor of the object): 被 (bèi) as a passive marker is a relatively new addition to the language, introduced as part of the early 20th century language reforms that also added gender-specific pronouns such as 他>她 and 你>妳 and culminated in attempts to Romanize Chinese entirely. There is a typical passive construction in Mandarin, namely Bei construction. It is commonly used to indicate result, direction, location, frequency, duration, manner, and appearance. Similar to English, Bei construction can also be analysed by A-movement which is locally restricted. The subject of the Bei clause is included in the complement clause where the “passivized” object controls the verb. Classically, 被 marked an adversative mood, indicating that something bad had happened. Even today, the following sentence is perfectly acceptable in speech: Recent development of Bei construction Recently, more syntacticians investigated passive voice in Mandarin. They discovered that passive voice in Mandarin is heavily dependent on the context of the sentence rather than the grammatical forms. Therefore, passive voice can be marked (e.g. by the most broadly used passive marker: Bei 被 [mentioned above]) or unmarked (see the \"Notional Passive\" section below) in both speech and writing. Those sentences have\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Voice (grammar)\nContent: text: In grammar, the voice (aka diathesis) of a verb describes the relationship between the action (or state) that the verb expresses and the participants identified by its arguments (subject, object, etc.). When the subject is the agent or doer of the action, the verb is in the active voice. When the subject is the patient, target or undergoer of the action, the verb is said to be in the passive voice. When the subject both performs and receives the action expressed by the verb, the verb is in the middle voice. The following pair of examples illustrates the contrast between active and passive voice in English. In sentence (1), the verb form ate is in the active voice, but in sentence (2), the verb form was eaten is in the passive voice. Independent of voice, the cat is the Agent (the doer) of the action of eating in both sentences. # The cat ate the mouse. # The mouse was eaten by the cat. In a transformation from an active-voice clause to an equivalent passive-voice construction, the subject and the direct object switch grammatical roles. The direct object gets promoted to subject, and the subject demoted to an (optional) adjunct. In the first example above, the mouse serves as the direct object in the active-voice version, but becomes the subject in the passive version. The subject of the active-voice version, the cat, becomes part of a prepositional phrase in the passive version of the sentence, and can be left out entirely; The mouse was eaten. ==Overview== ===History of the concept of voice=== In the grammar of Ancient Greek, voice was called διάθεσις (diáthesis) \"arrangement\" or \"condition\", with three subcategories: * active (ἐνέργεια [enérgeia]) * passive\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Passive voice\nContent: the verb plus an auxiliary verb, either be or get (called linking verbs in traditional grammar), to indicate passive voice. *The money was donated to the school. *The vase got broken during the fight. *All men are created equal. If the agent is mentioned, it usually appears in a prepositional phrase introduced by the preposition by. *Without agent: The paper was marked. *With agent: The paper was marked by Mr. Tan. The subject of the passive voice usually corresponds to the direct object of the corresponding active-voice formulation (as in the above examples), but English also allows passive constructions in which the subject corresponds to an indirect object or preposition complement: *We were given tickets. (subject we corresponds to the indirect object of give) *Tim was operated on yesterday. (subject Tim corresponds to the complement of the preposition on) In sentences of the second type, a stranded preposition is left. This is called the prepositional passive or pseudo-passive (although the latter term can also be used with other meanings). The active voice is the dominant voice used in English. Many commentators, notably George Orwell in his essay \"Politics and the English Language\" and Strunk & White in The Elements of Style, have urged minimizing use of the passive voice, but this is almost always based on these commentators' misunderstanding of what the passive voice is. Contrary to common critiques, the passive voice has important uses, with virtually all writers using the passive voice (including Orwell and Strunk & White). There is general agreement that the passive voice is useful for emphasis or when the receiver of the action is more important than the actor. Merriam–Webster's Dictionary of English Usage refers to three statistical studies of passive versus active sentences in various periodicals,\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Declension\nContent: : - (for nominative singular), - (genitive), - (dative), - (accusative), - (locative), - (instrumental), - (vocative), - (ablative) The above sentence could be formed with any of the following word orders and would have the same meaning: * \"The dog chased a cat.\" * \"A cat chased the dog.\" * \"Chased a cat the dog.\" As a more complex example, the sentence: * Mum, this little boy's dog was chasing a cat down our street! becomes nonsensical in English if the words are rearranged (because there are no cases): * A cat was down our street chasing dog this little boy's mum! But if English were a highly inflected language, like Latin or some Slavic languages such as Croatian, both sentences could mean the same thing. They would both contain five nouns in five different cases: mum – vocative (hey!), dog – nominative (who?), boy – genitive (of whom?), cat – accusative (whom?), street – locative (where?); the adjective little would be in the same case as the noun it modifies (boy), and the case of the determiner our would agree with the case of the noun it determines (street). Using the case suffixes invented for this example, the original sentence would read: * Mum, this little boy dog was chasing a cat down our street! And like other inflected languages, the sentence rearranged in the following ways would mean virtually the same thing, but with different expressiveness: * A cat was down our street chasing dog this little boy, mum! * Mum, down street our a cat was chasing this little boy dog! Instead of the locative, the instrumental form of \"down our street\" could also be used: * Mum,\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Passive voice\nContent: in the periphery that is not a core argument. It is marked by a non-core case or becomes part of an adpositional phrase, etc. This can be omitted, but there is always the option of including it. # There is some explicit marking of the construction. Dixon acknowledges that this excludes some constructions labeled as passive by some linguists. ==Adversative passive== In some languages, including several Southeast Asian languages, the passive voice is sometimes used to indicate that an action or event was unpleasant or undesirable. This so-called adversative passive works like the ordinary passive voice in terms of syntactic structure--that is, a theme or instrument acts as subject. In addition, the construction indicates adversative affect, suggesting that someone was negatively affected. In Japanese, for example, the adversative passive (also called indirect passive) indicates adversative affect. The indirect or adversative passive has the same form as the direct passive. Unlike the direct passive, the indirect passive may be used with intransitive verbs. Yup'ik, from the Eskimo–Aleut family, has two different suffixes that can indicate passive, -cir- and -ma-. The morpheme -cir- has an adversative meaning. If an agent is included in a passive sentence with the -cir passive, the noun is usually in the allative (oblique) case. ==Stative and dynamic passive== In some languages, for example English, there is often a similarity between clauses expressing an action or event in the passive voice and clauses expressing a state. For example, the string of words \"The dog is fed\" can have the following two different meanings: # The dog is fed (twice a day). # The dog is fed (so we can leave now). The additions in parentheses \"force\" the same string of words to clearly\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Passive voice\nContent: text: A passive voice construction is a grammatical voice construction that is found in many languages. In a clause with passive voice, the grammatical subject expresses the theme or patient of the main verb – that is, the person or thing that undergoes the action or has its state changed. This contrasts with active voice, in which the subject has the agent role. For example, in the passive sentence \"The tree was pulled down\", the subject (the tree) denotes the patient rather than the agent of the action. In contrast, the sentences \"Someone pulled down the tree\" and \"The tree is down\" are active sentences. Typically, in passive clauses, what is usually expressed by the object (or sometimes another argument) of the verb is now expressed by the subject, while what is usually expressed by the subject is either omitted or is indicated by some adjunct of the clause. Thus, turning an active sense of a verb into a passive sense is a valence-decreasing process (\"detransitivizing process\"), because it syntactically turns a transitive sense into an intransitive sense. This is not always the case; for example in Japanese a passive-voice construction does not necessarily decrease valence. Many languages have both an active and a passive voice; this allows for greater flexibility in sentence construction, as either the semantic agent or patient may take the syntactic role of subject. The use of passive voice allows speakers to organize stretches of discourse by placing figures other than the agent in subject position. This may be done to foreground the patient, recipient, or other thematic role; it may also be useful when the semantic patient is the topic of on-going discussion. The passive voice may also be used to avoid specifying the agent of an action. ==Passive\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Voice (grammar)\nContent: out the noun phrase, Irish uses the autonomous; where English includes the noun phrase, Irish uses its periphrastic passive – which can also leave out the noun phrase: The impersonal endings have been re- analysed as a passive voice in Modern Welsh and the agent can be included after the preposition gan (by): :Darllenir y papur newydd. The newspaper is read. :Cenir y gân gan y côr. :The song is sung by the choir. ==Dynamic and static passive== Some linguists draw a distinction between static (or stative) passive voice and dynamic (or eventive) passive voice in some languages. Examples include English, German, Swedish, Spanish and Italian. \"Static\" means that an action was, is, or will be done to the subject at a certain point in time that did, does, or will result in a state in the time focused upon, whereas \"dynamic\" means that an action was, is, or will be taking place. ===German=== * Static passive auxiliary verb: sein * Dynamic passive auxiliary verb: werden : Der Rasen ist gemäht (\"The lawn is mown\", static) : Der Rasen wird gemäht (\"The lawn is being mown\", literally \"The lawn becomes mown\", dynamic) ===English=== * Static passive auxiliary verb: be (the \"be-passive\") * Dynamic passive auxiliary verb: get (the \"get-passive\") Note that for some speakers of English the dynamic passive constructed with get is not accepted and is considered colloquial or sub-standard. : The grass is cut (static) : The grass gets cut or The grass is being cut (dynamic) ===Swedish=== * Static passive auxiliary verb: vara (är, var, varit) * Dynamic passive auxiliary verb: bli (blir, blev, blivit) Dynamic passive in Swedish is also frequently expressed with the\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Voice (grammar)\nContent: tone. It is the most common form of passive voice in Mandarin and is extremely colloquial. Passive marker is excluded in notional passive because the sentence relies on the hearer's common sense or their knowledge of the world. Thus, this passive voice is expressed implicitly. Furthermore, notional passive sentences can be representing either positive or negative meanings. Here is an example of notional passive: File:Mandarin notional.png|Mandarin notional passive In other voices in Mandarin, “object + transitive verb” construction is usually used. However, “topic + explanatory comment” is the common structure for notional passive. There is no surface passive marker in the sentence, but the underlying meaning does carry a passive voice. The negation of notional passive is similar to English negation. Both are achieved by adding the negator “mei(you)没(有)” right before the transitive verb. In fact, in negation, “le” is no longer necessary in the sentence. Here is an example of negation of notional passive: File:Mandarin negative notional.png|Mandarin negative notional passive (Note: Both examples are adapted from Yip et al. (2016), Chapter 13) Most objects present in notional passive are inanimate objects because ambiguity can arise if we use animate objects in these sentences. To avoid this problem, formal or lexical passive markers will be introduced in the sentence. ====== Formal passive ====== A formal passive marker is introduced as \"bei\" and it is usually in narrative tone. It is generally used as the narration or description of an event that has already taken place. Additionally, formal passive sentences can only represent negative meanings, otherwise it is ungrammatical. It can be used in both informal and formal contexts.

Contrary to common critiques, the passive voice has important uses, with virtually all writers using the passive voice (including Orwell and Strunk & White). There is general agreement that the passive voice is useful for emphasis or when the receiver of the action is more important than the actor. Merriam–Webster's Dictionary of English Usage refers to three statistical studies of passive versus active sentences in various periodicals,\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Voice (grammar)\nContent: F., & Kittilä, S. (2019). Grammatical voice. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Some languages, such as English and Spanish, use a periphrastic passive voice; that is, it is not a single word form, but rather a construction making use of other word forms. Specifically, it is made up of a form of the auxiliary verb to be and a past participle of the main verb which carries the lexical content of the predicate. In other languages, such as Latin, the passive voice for some tenses is simply marked on the verb by inflection: librum legit \"He reads the book\"; liber legitur \"The book is read\". Passives mark this voice in English syntactically as well, which often involves subject–object inversion and the use of ‘by’. Sentence (2) is an example of passive voice, where something (the castles) has been (notionally) acted upon by someone (Roger Bigod). (2) The castles were seen by Roger Bigod. File:Passive voice.png|English passive voice, adapted from ====Antipassive voice==== The antipassive voice deletes or demotes the object of transitive verbs, and promotes the actor to an intransitive subject. This voice is very common among ergative–absolutive languages (which may feature passive voices as well), but also occurs among nominative–accusative languages. ====Middle voice==== Some languages (such as Albanian, Bengali, Fula, Tamil, Sanskrit, Icelandic, Swedish and Ancient Greek) have a middle voice, which is a set of inflections or constructions which is to some extent different from both the active and passive voices. The subject of such middle voice is like the subject of active voice as well as the subject of passive voice, in that it performs an action, and is also affected by that action. Another difference between middle voice\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Levantine Arabic grammar\nContent: preferred in the present tense.

It is possible to convert this to a passive by promoting the content clause to subject; in this case, however, the clause typically does not change its position in the sentence, and an expletive it takes the normal subject position: *It is said that he cheats. Another way of forming passives in such cases involves promoting the subject of the content clause to the subject of the main clause, and converting the content clause into a non-finite clause with the to-infinitive. This infinitive is marked for grammatical aspect to correspond to the aspect (or past tense) expressed in the content clause. For example: *They say that he cheats. → He is said to cheat. *They think that I am dying. → I am thought to be dying. *They report that she came back / has come back. → She is reported to have come back. *They say that she will resign. → e.g. She is said to be going to resign. Some verbs are used almost exclusively in the passive voice. This is the case with rumor, for example. The following passive sentences are possible: * He was rumored to be a war veteran. / It was rumored that he was a war veteran. but it is not possible to use the active counterpart *They rumored that he was a war veteran. (This was once possible, but has fallen out of use.) Another situation in which the passive uses a different construction than the active involves the verb make, meaning \"compel\".

Subject pronouns can be placed before a negative particle for emphasis: My ny vynnav kewsel Sowsnek ’I will not speak English’ or ’As for me, I will not speak English’ (said to be Dolly Pentreath's last words). === Fronting for emphasis === Besides the “neutral” structures given above, elements of Cornish sentences can be fronted to give emphasis, or when responding to a question with requested information. Fronting involves moving the element to the beginning of the sentence. English typically achieves this by modifying tone or intonation. There are two particles involved in fronting. The particle a is actually a relative particle used when the subject or direct object of a sentence is fronted. If anything else is fronted, usually adverbials or information headed by prepositions, the particle used is y (yth before a vowel).

This is exactly what the passive voice does. The semantics of this construction emphasizes the original P and downgrades the original A and is used to avoid mentioning A, draw attention to P or the result of the activity. :::(a) Don (A) is cooking dinner (P). :::(b) Dinner (S) is being cooked (by Don). :2. P is removed from the core and becomes an oblique. Similarly, the clause becomes intransitive and the original A becomes S. The semantics of this construction emphasizes the original A and downgrades the original P and is used when the action includes a patient, but the patient is given little or no attention. These are difficult to convey in English. :::(a) Don (A) is crushing a soda can (P). :::(b) Don (S) is crushing.

For example, when compared to a canonical European passive, the passive construction in other languages is justified in its name. However, when comparing passives across the world's languages, they do not share a single common feature.Siewierska, Anna (1984). Passive: A Comparative Linguistic Analysis. London: Croom Helm. R. M.

Another advisor, Joseph M. Williams, who has written several books on style, states with greater clarity that the passive is often the better choice.For instance: According to Williams, the choice between active and passive depends on the answers to three questions: # \"Must the reader know who is responsible for the action?\" # \"Would the active or passive verb help your readers move more smoothly from one sentence to the next? # \"Would the active or passive give readers a more consistent and appropriate point of view?\" Bryan A. Garner, in Garner's Modern English Usage, stresses the advantages of the active voice, but gives the following examples of where the passive is preferred: * \"When the actor is unimportant.\" * \"When the actor is unknown.\" * \"When you want to hide the actor's identity.\" * \"When you need to put the punch word at the end of the sentence.\" * \"When the focus of the sentence is on the thing being acted on.\" * \"When the passive simply sounds better.\" Merriam–Webster's Dictionary of English Usage recommends the passive voice when identifying the object (receiver) of the action is more important than the subject (agent), and\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Lithuanian grammar\nContent: past passive participle dichotomy.

During the 20th century there were only seven minor confrontations over water, with 145 treaties signed in the same 100 years. Through academic research, policy and hydro-diplomacy the Geneva Water Hub works to shift the global dialogue from ‘water and conflict’ to ‘water for peace and cooperation’, to deliver better water governance and the long-term protection of critical water resources and infrastructure. === Global High-Level Panel on Water and Peace === In 2015, the Geneva Water Hub began working as Secretariat to the Global High Level Panel on Water and Peace – a 15 country co-convened initiative focused on strengthening the global framework to prevent and resolve water-related conflicts and to facilitate the use of water as an instrument of peace and cooperation. In its 2017 report “A Matter of Survival” the Global High-Level Panel on Water and Peace outlined its recommendations for a fundamental rethinking of international water cooperation from the UN Security Council to other multilateral institutions and down to grass-roots level organisations. === Water Governance Education === At the University of Geneva, the Geneva Water Hub runs an annual Summer School in Water Governance and a distance learning course on International Water Law and the Law of Transboundary Aquifers.

Hartelius calls attention to two competing norm systems of expertise: “network norms of dialogic collaboration” and “deferential norms of socially sanctioned professionalism”; Wikipedia being evidence of the first. Drawing on a Bakhtinian framework, Hartelius posits that Wikipedia is an example of an epistemic network that is driven by the view that individuals’ ideas clash with one another so as to generate expertise collaboratively. Hartelius compares Wikipedia's methodology of open- ended discussions of topics to that of Bakhtin's theory of speech communication, where genuine dialogue is considered a live event, which is continuously open to new additions and participants. Hartelius acknowledges that knowledge, experience, training, skill, and qualification are important dimensions of expertise but posits that the concept is more complex than sociologists and psychologists suggest. Arguing that expertise is rhetorical, then, Hartelius explains that expertise \"is not simply about one person's skills being different from another's. It is also fundamentally contingent on a struggle for ownership and legitimacy.\" Effective communication is an inherent element in expertise in the same style as knowledge is. Rather than leaving each other out, substance and communicative style are complementary. Hartelius further suggests that Wikipedia's dialogic construction of expertise illustrates both the instrumental and the constitutive dimensions of rhetoric; instrumentally as it challenges traditional encyclopedias and constitutively as a function of its knowledge production. Going over the historical development of the encyclopedic project, Hartelius argues that changes in traditional encyclopedias have led to changes in traditional expertise. Wikipedia's use of hyperlinks to connect one topic to another depends on, and develops, electronic interactivity meaning that Wikipedia's way of knowing is dialogic. Dialogic expertise then, emerges from multiple interactions between utterances within the\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Dialogic learning\nContent: or valid by imposing it by means of force, or by being ready to enter a dialogue in which other people's arguments may lead us to rectify our initial stances. In the first case, the interactant holds power claims, while in the second case, validity claims are held. While in power claims, the argument of force is applied; in validity claims, the force of an argument prevails. Validity claims are the basis of dialogic learning. ===Bakhtin: dialogic imagination=== Mikhail Bakhtin established (1981) that there is a need of creating meanings in a dialogic way with other people. His concept of dialogism states a relation among language, interaction, and social transformation. Bakhtin believes that the individual does not exist outside of dialogue. The concept of dialogue, itself, establishes the existence of the \"other\" person. In fact, it is through dialogue that the \"other\" cannot be silenced or excluded. Bakhtin states that meanings are created in processes of reflection between people. And these are the same meanings that we use in later conversations with others, where those meanings get amplified and even change as we acquire new meanings. In this sense, Bakhtin states that every time that we talk about something that we have read about, seen or felt; we are actually reflecting the dialogues we have had with others, showing the meanings that we have created in previous dialogues. This is, what is said cannot be separated from the perspectives of others: the individual speech and the collective one are deeply related. It is in this sense that Bakhtin talks about chain of dialogues, to point that every dialogue results from a previous one and, at the same time, every new dialogue is going to be present in future ones. ===CREA: dialogic\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Energy policy of Canada\nContent: Generation Energy Council was informed by a 2017 national dialogue which included a Generation Energy Forum held in Winnipeg in October, on a \"low-carbon energy future\". In December 2017, Natural Resources Canada established the Generation Energy Council, composed of \"energy thought leaders with diverse perspectives and expertise on Canada's energy systems\" as a follow-up to the forum. According to the \"Canada’s Energy Transition\" report, the decoupling of Canadian energy use and GDP growth from 1990 to 2015, was confirmed by statistics showing that during that period, Canada's GDP grew by almost 80 percent, while Canadian energy use increased by only 30 percent. In June 2016, Prime Minister Trudeau, said that he supported \"interprovincial efforts to get carbon emissions down and emphasize hydroelectricity as a power source.\" BC Hydro's $8.8-billion Site C hydroelectric project on Peace River in northeastern B.C. which is slated for completion in 2024, would supply electricity to Alberta to decrease Alberta's dependency on natural gas and coal. In April 2020, during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, Prime Minister Trudeau's energy policy appeared to appease both environmentalists and the oil industry. The COVID-19 recession, the 2020 stock market crash, and the 2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war which resulted in the \"collapse in oil prices\", left Alberta with its \"greatest challenge\" in the province's \"modern history, threatening its main industry and wreaking havoc on its finances.\" While announcing a \"series of measures to support the oil and gas industry\", Trudeau said that \"Just because we're in a health crisis doesn't mean we can neglect the environmental crisis.\" Some of the \"measures had a complementary goal of addressing serious environmental concerns.\" ==International Energy Statistics (IEA) as of 2014== Energy in CanadaIEA Key World Energy Statistics Statistics\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Expert\nContent: expertise then, emerges from multiple interactions between utterances within the discourse community. The ongoing dialogue between contributors on Wikipedia not only results in the emergence of truth; it also explicates the topics one can be an expert of. As Hartelius explains, \"the very act of presenting information about topics that are not included in traditional encyclopedias is a construction of new expertise.\" While Wikipedia insists that contributors must only publish preexisting knowledge, the dynamics behind dialogic expertise creates new information nonetheless. Knowledge production is created as a function of dialogue. According to Hartelius, dialogic expertise has emerged on Wikipedia not only because of its interactive structure but also because of the site's hortative discourse which is not found in traditional encyclopedias. By Wikipedia's hortative discourse, Hartelius means various encouragements to edit certain topics and instructions on how to do so that appear on the site. One further reason to the emergence of dialogic expertise on Wikipedia is the site's community pages, which function as a techne; explicating Wikipedia's expert methodology. ===Networked expertise=== Building on Hartelius, Damien Pfister developed the concept of \"networked expertise\". Noting that Wikipedia employs a \"many to many\" rather than a \"one to one\" model of communication, he notes how expertise likewise shifts to become a quality of a group rather than an individual. With the information traditionally associated with individual experts now stored within a text produced by a collective, knowing about something is less important than knowing how to find something. As he puts it, \"With the internet, the historical power of subject matter expertise is eroded: the archival nature of the Web means that what and how to information is readily available.\" The rhetorical authority previously afforded to subject matter expertise, then, is\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Holocentric\nContent: dialog process, emergent properties arise in the strategy due to the interplay between the various stakeholder viewpoints. In order to improve the effectiveness of a community's responses, consideration must be given to techniques which can deal with complex systems and the advancement of critical thinking skills. Such techniques often employ aspects of systems thinking to help community members better appreciate and deal with the complex interdependencies and conflicts that arise between stakeholder views. As the community becomes more effective in the process of dialog, it may become more self-aware, and this ‘systemic’ heightening of awareness may lead to additional emergent properties which in turn may further increase the overall level of understanding and quality of the community response. Within a cooperative community, the catalysts for the emergent understanding are the insights gained through inspirational learning and the abstract concepts learned through experiential learning. Educational approaches aimed at managing the critical learning process through the application of the Miller / Bawden Quadrants have been used in a number of different domains, most commonly those in which a wide variety of stakeholders are forced to formulate strategies dealing with limited natural resources. In this environment, agreement amongst sufficiently powerful stakeholders in any community will inevitably involve negotiated trade-offs, for example between productivity, equity, sustainability and stability.WORKSHOP ON NATIONAL AND BASIN LEVEL DIALOGUE, BONN, DECEMBER 1 AND 2, 2001 ==Footnotes== ==Further reading== * Bawden, R.J.

In November 2007 the Brazilian head of state Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and his Argentinian counterpart Cristina Fernández de Kirchner agreed to prioritize construction of the Garabí binational dam. Next day the planning ministers of Brazil and Argentina endorsed the presidents' agreements on exchange of energy.

In November 2009 the presidents signed an agreement to form a joint international company to supervise construction, operation and maintenance of the Garabí Binational Hydroelectric Complex. In mid-2013 Eletrobras held a public meeting sponsored by the Council for Economic and Social Development to discuss the proposed Garabi and Panambí hydroelectric plants. Over 500 attendees included farmers, fishermen, politicians and others from both countries.

Particularly, they were interested in how these different groups resolved non-canonical object- relative constructions that contained an ambiguous noun with a strong biasing context. For example, a prior experiment used the following sentence: \"The professor insisted that the exam be completed in ink, so Jimmy used the new pen (Probe Position1), that his mother-in-law recently (Probe Position2) purchased (Probe Position3) because the multiple colors allowed for more creativity.\" This object-relative construction is considered non-canonical because the direct object \"pen\" occurs before its associated verb \"purchased\". Thus, it can be considered a \"fronted direct object\". The argument relies on the ambiguity of the word, \"pen\" which could mean either a writing instrument, or a jail cell. The Probe Positions 1, 2 and 3 indicated in the sentence above indicate the points at which the study participants were presented with a word on a computer screen, in a cross-modal decision task similar to the one described above. Moreover, the Probes represented either one (\"pencil\") or another interpretation (\"jail\") of the noun \"pen\" or were non-related controls (\"jacket\" or \"tale\") or a non-word of equivalent length.

This is represented in the following sentence: 10.i) Betsyi λx (x loves heri dog) and Sandy λy (y loves heri dog) The VPs that are being represented by λx and λy are syntactically identical. For this reason the one that is being c-commanded (λy) can be deleted. This then forms: 10.ii) Betsyi loves heri dog and Sandyj does ∅ too Sloppy reading The sloppy reading of this sentence is \"Betsy loves Betsy's dog and Sandy loves Sandy's dog\". That is, both women love their own dog. This is represented in the following sentence: 10.iii) Betsyi λx (x loves heri dog) and Sandyj λy (y loves herj dog) Since the embedded clauses are identical, the logic of this form is that the variable x must be bound to the same noun phrase in both cases. Therefore, \"Betsy\" is in the commanding position that determines the interpretation of the second clause. The Pro → BV rule that converts pronouns into bound variables can be applied to all the pronouns. This then allows for the sentence in 10.iii) to be: 10.iv) Betsyi λx (x loves x's dog) & Sandyj λy (y loves y's dog) Another way the VP can be syntactically identical is, if λx(A) and λy(B) where every instance of x in A has a corresponding instance of y in B.

This term and the term climate emergency have been used to describe the threat of global warming to humanity and the planet, and to urge aggressive climate change mitigation. In the scientific journal BioScience, a January 2020 article, endorsed by over 11,000 scientists worldwide, stated that \"the climate crisis has arrived\" and that an \"immense increase of scale in endeavors to conserve our biosphere is needed to avoid untold suffering due to the climate crisis.\" The term is applied by those who \"believe it evokes the gravity of the threats the planet faces from continued greenhouse gas emissions and can help spur the kind of political willpower that has long been missing from climate advocacy\". They believe that, much as \"global warming\" drew out more emotional engagement and support for action than \"climate change\", calling climate change a crisis could have an even stronger impact. A study has shown that the term invokes a strong emotional response in conveying a sense of urgency; some caution that this response may be counter-productive, and may cause a backlash effect due to perceptions of alarmist exaggeration. == Scientific basis == While powerful language had long been used in advocacy, politics and media, until the late 2010s the scientific community traditionally remained more constrained in its language. However, in a November 2019 statement published in the January 2020 issue of the scientific journal BioScience, a group of over 11,000 scientists argued that describing global warming as a climate emergency or climate crisis was appropriate. The scientists stated that an \"immense increase of scale in endeavor\" is needed to conserve the biosphere, but noted\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Wildlife observation\nContent: placing more signs about possible animal crossings zones would cause drivers to drive more carefully and therefore have fewer accidents. Economically, this means that more families will be saving money and it could be used in a different way to help contributed to society as a whole. ==Issues leading to the extinction of animals== ===Climate change=== Climate change is one of the most heavily discussed topics around the world today, both politically and scientifically. The climate that Earth is currently experiencing has been steadily changing over time due to both natural causes and human exploitation. Climate change has the potential to be detrimental to wildlife across the world, whether that be through rising sea levels, changes in temperatures through the years, or deforestation. These are just a few of the examples of the contributing factors to climate change. Climate change is not something that citizens can entirely prevent from happening even if they wanted to. There are many natural causes such as volcanic activity and the Earth's orbit around the sun that are strong contributing factors to the phenomena. There are, however, prevention measures that can be taken to prevent climate change from happening as quickly. The primary way to prevent climate change is for society to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases that are present in the atmosphere. This can be done through the improving of energy efficiency in many buildings, the stoppage of deforestation so more carbon dioxide can be removed from the atmosphere, and mode switching. ====Rising sea levels==== One of the more notable effects climate change has on the environment is the rising of sea levels around the world. Over the past 100 years, the sea level has risen approximately 1.8 millimeters each year. The steady rise in sea levels can be attributed\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Effects of climate change on ecosystems\nContent: text: Climate change has adversely affected terrestrial and marine ecosystems, including tundras, mangroves, coral reefs, and caves. Increasing global temperature, more frequent occurrence of extreme weather, and rising sea level are examples of the most impactful effects of climate change. Possible consequences of these effects include species decline and extinction, change within ecosystems, increased prevalence of invasive species, forests converting from carbon sinks to carbon sources, ocean acidification, disruption of the water cycle, and increased occurrence of natural disasters. ==General== Climate change is affecting terrestrial ecoregions. Increasing global temperature means that ecosystems are changing; some species are being forced out of their habitats (possibly to extinction) because of changing conditions. An example is migration. Due to the ever hotter weather, birds are forced to move to foreign lands. Other effects of global warming include less snow fall, rising sea levels, Ozone depleting and weather changes. These may influence human activities and the ecosystem. Within the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, experts assessed the literature on the impacts of climate change on ecosystems. Rosenzweig et al. (2007) concluded that over the last three decades, human-induced warming had likely had a discernible influence on many physical and biological systems (p. 81). Schneider et al. (2007) concluded, with very high confidence, that regional temperature trends had already affected species and ecosystems around the world (p. 792). They also concluded that climate change would result in the extinction of many species and a reduction in the diversity of different types of ecosystems (p. 792). * Terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity: With a warming of 4-5 °C, relative to 2010 levels, it is likely that global terrestrial vegetation would become a net source of carbon (Schneider et al., 2007:792). With high confidence, Schneider et al.\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Psychology of climate change denial\nContent: changes in overall average global temperatures, both of which are difficult, if not impossible, for one single person to discern. Due to these distances in time, space, and influence, climate change becomes a far-away, abstract issue that does not demand immediate attention. === Framing === In popular climate discourse framing, the three dominant framing ideas have been apocalypse, uncertainty and high costs/losses. These framings create intense feelings of fear and doom and helplessness. Framing climate change in these ways creates thoughts that nothing can be done to change the trajectory, that any solution will be too expensive and do too little, or that it is not worth trying to find a solution to something we are unsure is happening. Climate change has been framed this way for years, and so these messages are instilled in peoples’ minds, elicited whenever the words “climate change” are brought up. === Dissonance === Because there is little solid action that people can take on a daily basis to combat climate change, then some believe climate change must not be as pressing an issue as it is made out to be. An example of this phenomenon is that most people know smoking cigarettes is not healthy, yet people continue to smoke cigarettes, and so an inner discomfort is elicited by the contradiction in ‘thinking’ and ‘doing’. A similar cognitive dissonance is created when people know that things like driving, flying, and eating meat are causing climate change, but the infrastructure is not in place to change those behaviors effectively. In order to address this dissonance, climate change is rejected or downplayed. This dissonance also fuels denial, wherein people cannot find a solution to an anxiety-inducing problem, and so the problem is denied outright. Creating stories that climate change\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Climate crisis\nContent: endeavor\" is needed to conserve the biosphere, but noted \"profoundly troubling signs\" including sustained increases in livestock populations, meat production, tree cover loss, fossil fuel consumption, air transport, and CO2 emissions—concurrent with upward trends in climate impacts such as rising temperatures, global ice melt, and extreme weather, which in turn can also have many indirect impacts such as large-scale migration and food insecurity. Also in November 2019, an article published in Nature concluded that evidence from climate tipping points alone suggests that \"we are in a state of planetary emergency\", defining emergency as a product of risk and urgency, with both factors judged to be \"acute\". The Nature article referenced recent IPCC Special Reports (2018, 2019) suggesting individual tipping points could be exceeded with as little as 1–2 °C of global average warming (current warming is ~1 °C), with a global cascade of tipping points possible with greater warming. == Definitions == In the context of climate change, Pierre Mukheibir, Professor of Water Futures at the University of Technology Sydney, states that the term crisis is \"a crucial or decisive point or situation that could lead to a tipping point,\" one involving an \"unprecedented circumstance.\" A dictionary definition states that \"crisis\" in this context means \"a turning point or a condition of instability or danger,\" and implies that \"action needs to be taken now or else the consequences will be disastrous.\" Another definition differentiates the term from global warming and climate change and defines climate crisis as \"the various negative effects that unmitigated climate change is causing or threatening to cause on our planet, especially where these effects have a direct impact on humanity.\" == Use of the term == === Historical === Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore has used\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Economic impacts of climate change\nContent: and technological) are likely to have a greater effect on human society than climate change. On the other hand, major (\"non-marginal\") impacts could occur with abrupt changes in natural and social systems. Scientific understanding of abrupt changes is limited. Another consideration is how vulnerability to climate change varies with scale. At local scales, extreme weather events can have a significant impact, especially in vulnerable locations. Another potentially significant impact is the long- term effect of sea-level rise on low-lying coastal areas. ===Comments on relative impacts=== Bostrom (2009) Bostrom, N. The Future of Humanity, in: New Waves in Philosophy of Technology, eds. Jan-Kyrre Berg Olsen, Evan Selinger & Soren Riis (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009) (PDF) comments that: > Even the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, a report prepared > for the British Government which has been criticized by some as overly > pessimistic, estimates that under the assumption of business-as-usual with > regard to emissions, global warming will reduce welfare by an amount > equivalent to a permanent reduction in per capita consumption of between 5 > and 20%.

Already in 2009, a publication in the well- known general medical journal The Lancet stated: \"Climate change is the biggest global health threat of the 21st century\". This was re-iterated in 2015 by a statement of the World Health Organisation. In 2019, the Australian Medical Association formally declared climate change a health emergency. Studies have found that communication on climate change is more likely to lead to engagement by the public if it is framed as a health concern, rather than just as an environmental matter. == Root causes == === Effects of climate change === === Climate change vulnerability === A 2021 report published in The Lancet found that climate change does not affect people's health in an equal way. The greatest impact tends to fall on the most vulnerable such as the poor, women, children, the elderly, people with pre-existing health concerns, other minorities and outdoor workers. There are certain predictors of health patterns that determine the social vulnerability of the individuals. These can be grouped into \"demographic, socioeconomic, housing, health (such as pre- existing health conditions), neighbourhood, and geographical factors\". == Overview of health impacts == === Types of pathways affecting health === The effects of climate change on human health can be grouped into direct and indirect effects. Both types of effects interact with social dynamics. The combination of effects and social dynamics determines the eventual health outcomes. Mechanisms and social dynamics are explained further below: * Direct mechanisms or risks: changes in extreme weather and resultant increased storms, floods, droughts, heat waves and wildfires * Indirect mechanisms or risks: these are mediated through changes in the biosphere (e.g., the burden of disease and redistribution of disease vectors, or food availability, water\n\nID: 7\nTitle: World Ocean Conference\nContent: by land- based and sea-based pollution, alien invasive species, unsustainable use of marine and coastal resources, physical alteration, poor land-use planning, and socio-economic pressures, equally concerned over marine ecosystems and living resources being affected by sea level rise, increased water temperature, ocean acidification, changing weather patterns, and other variations that may result from climate change, and how these alterations may aggravate the existing pressures of marine environmental degradation and increase risks to global food security, economic prosperity, and the well-being of human populations. Realizing the detrimental effects and importance of climate change, The WOC agreed to discuss the commitments on how to increase the role ocean in reducing the impact of climate change. The WOC have three main interests of states: * SIDS - very concern on sea-level rise (Indonesia is the largest archipelagical country in the world). Climate change is particularly threatening to Indonesia as sea level rise would adversely affect many Indonesia's low-lying coastal areas. * Tropical developing states - on adaptation measures, food security, and livelihood * Developed states - observing the possibility that the ocean could function as \"Carbon Sink\" ==Objectives== The main purpose of the WOC 2009 was the adoption of Manado Ocean Declaration (MOD). The declaration consists of 14 core opening paragraphs and 21 points of operative agreement. The contents of the declaration include the commitment to long-term conservation, management, and sustainable use of marine living resources, establish national strategies to sustainably manage marine and coastal ecosystems and enhance their resilience, reduce land- and sea-based pollution, and also to increase understanding and information exchange on coasts, oceans and climate change, particularly in developing countries. Despite criticism the MOD was not strong enough to push the international community to help developing nations deal with the impacts\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Find the main idea of the following passage: 'Climate change is an increasingly contentious global issue.

Basically, a high tone immediately following a low tone is pronounced at a slightly lower frequency than a previous high tone. Additionally, a slightly more dramatic lowering of pitch (a downstep) may occur between certain syllables. In Sesotho, the downstep (indicated with a !) naturally occurs between words (being less noticeable if the first word has no low tones) though there is at least\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Chichewa tones\nContent: or refers to the future, has exactly the same tones as for described above. ====Tones of -ngo-==== When added to a toneless tense, 'just' has a tone after it, as in tone pattern 4: : 'just help!' : 'I have just helped' : 'if I just help' With other tenses it has the tones of pattern 8, that is, it has a tone before it and after it, while itself is low: : 'I was just helping' (Imperfect) : 'I will just help' (Remote Future) ====Tones of -ba-/-baa-==== The aspect-marker , usually pronounced 'meanwhile', is referred to by MchomboMchombo (2004), pp. 30, 31. and by Downing and MtenjeDowning & Mtenje (2017), p. 154. as the 'continuative'. When used with as an imperative, the infix is toneless, but there is a tone on the penultimate: : 'help meanwhile' As a subjunctive, it has tones on both and the penultimate, i.e. pattern 5. In a monosyllabic verb the second tone is on the final. The final vowel is always a: : 'let me help meanwhile' : 'let's have a drink meanwhile' ==Intonational tones== In addition to the ordinary lexical tones which go with individual words, and the grammatical tones of verb tenses, other tones can be heard which show phrasing or indicate a question. ===Boundary tones=== thumb|right|Voicetrack of the sentence ('A man, he rules women') (Myers (1996), p. 34), illustrating a boundary tone after , and also the typical downdrift of tones through the sentence.

In negative tenses different tonal patterns are used.For different negative tenses see Mtenje (1986), p. 244ff; Mtenje (1987), p. 183ff; Kanerva (1990), p. 23; Downing & Mtenje (2017), pp. 173–198. For example, in the negative subjunctive, the tone moves to the penultimate: : \"you should go\" : \"you shouldn't go\" Some tenses have two different negative intonations, depending on the meaning. For example, the Simple Past (Remote Perfect) \"I bought\" has the following negatives with different meanings:Mtenje (1987), p. 184. Downing & Mtenje (2017), pp. 182–191, omits the second of these. : (or ) \"I didn't buy it\" : \"I haven't bought it yet\" Certain tenses also have a different tonal pattern when used in a positive relative clause. For example, the potential tense is normally toneless, but in a relative clause it acquires a tone on the first and penultimate syllables. The tone of an object-marker such as below is lost:Downing & Mtenje (2017), p. 204. : \"they can explain to us\" : \"who can explain to us\" Not all tenses change their tonal pattern in a relative clause.

In a monosyllabic verb, the second tone is lost by Meeussen's Rule. An example of this pattern is the Remote Imperfect with : : 'I used to explain, I was explaining (in the past)' : 'I used to help, I was helping' : 'I used to hit, I was hitting' : 'I used to eat, I was eating' Other tenses with this pattern are the subjunctives with and , various tenses with the aspect-marker , and tenses with negative pattern 3a (see below): : 'I should be helping' : 'I should help (later)' : 'I should help (there)' : 'whenever I help' : 'to be helping, to help regularly' : 'I'm always helping'Maxson (2011), p. 126. : 'I can't help'Downing & Mtenje (2017), p. 193. Also included in this group is the Continuative Subjunctive, but because the tense-marker has two syllables, the tones in shorter verbs are slightly different from the above:Downing & Mtenje (2017), pp. 154, 156. : 'I should help meanwhile' : 'let me go meanwhile' : 'let me eat meanwhile' The Continuative Subjunctive is also heard with tone pattern 9, i.e. with a single tone on the penultimate. With all tenses in pattern 5, when an object-marker such as 'him/her' or the aspect-marker 'go and' is added, it loses its tone. A monosyllabic verb with an object-marker acts like a two-syllable verb that has no object-marker:Downing & Mtenje (2017), p. 157. : 'I used to help him' : 'I used to hit him' : 'I used to kill them'\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Chichewa tones\nContent: to an imperative as well, either with the supporting vowel or with the prefix . The final vowel is always -a and the tones are pattern 4: : 'just tell me!' : 'just tell me!' The prefixes and add a tone on the penultimate (pattern 9): : 'help meanwhile' : 'keep helping!' The negative of the imperative is derived from 'of' with the negative infinitive. The tones are pattern 6 with a tone on ó-' (which does not spread) and a second tone on the penultimate:Downing & Mtenje (2017), p. 183. : 'don't hurry!' If an object- marker is added the negative subjunctive form is usually used, although the form with ó is also possible.Mchombo (2004), pp. 34–5> In the subjunctive, the only tone is on the penultimate syllable: : 'don't ask me!' :( 'don't ask me!') : 'don't go and tie them (the mats) up!' ===Tones of ('am', 'are', 'is')=== As well as the word 'is/are' used for identity (e.g. 'he is a teacher') Chichewa has another verb 'am, are, is' used for position or temporary state (e.g. 'he is well', 'he is in Lilongwe'). The tones of this are irregular in that in the Present Simple, there is no tone on the subject- marker.Maxson (2011), p. 79; Stevick et al. (1965), p.1. For the Remote Past, both and Mpanje (1983), p. 141; Stevick et al. (1965), p. 156. can be heard, apparently without difference of meaning.

In main clauses the tones are as follows: : 'I am' : 'I was (recent)' : 'I\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Chichewa tones\nContent: the aspect-marker 'just' is added to a toneless tense: : 'just help!' : 'if I just help' However, when 'just' is added to other tenses, there are tones before and after (pattern 8):Downing & Mtenje (2017), p. 166. : 'I am just helping' : 'I was just helping' : 'I usually just help' When an object-marker or the aspect-marker or is added to tenses in this pattern or pattern 8, an extra tone is heard. In 4 or 5-syllable verbs this second tone is heard on the penultimate, in three-syllable verbs on the final, in two-syllable verbs on the final with a plateau. In one-syllable verbs it disappears. The first tone can spread in longer verbs:Downing & Mtenje (20170, p. 152. : 'I am explaining to him' : 'I am helping him' : 'I am hitting him' : 'I am killing him' But when is added to , the tones change to pattern 5: : 'I am always helping' : 'to be regularly helping' The negative of the Present Continuous, Imperfect, and Recent Past remains in the same pattern but with the addition of at the beginning. The tone of spreads to the subject-marker: : 'I am not helping' : 'I was not helping' : 'I did not help (just now)' (rarely used) The negative infinitive, on the other hand, has negative tone pattern 2: : 'not to help' ====Pattern 5 (-nká-)==== In this pattern there is a tone on the tense-marker and on the penultimate. The first tone does not spread, but there is a fall to a low tone after it. The second tone is lower in pitch than the first.

For example, the present habitual tense has tones on the first and penultimate syllables, the recent past has a tone after the tense-marker -na-, the subjunctive has a tone on the final syllable and the potential is toneless. The tones apply, with minor variations, to all verbs, whether the stem is long or short: *ndímafotokóza \"I (usually) explain\" *ndinafótokoza \"I explained (just now)\" *ndifotokozé \"I should explain\" *ndingafotokoze \"I could explain\" When a verb has a penultimate accent, most other tones tend to be suppressed. For example, in the negative future, both the tone of the future-tense marker, -dzá-, and the tone of the negative marker, sí- (both normally high), are neutralised: * _si_ ndi _dza_ fotokóza \"I will not explain\" Those and other processes cause most verb tenses to have only one or two high tones, which are at the beginning, the penultimate or the final of the verb stem or at a prefix or sometimes even both. That gives the impression that the tones in the resultant words have a clearly-accentual quality. ===English=== Most dialects of English are classified as stress-accent languages. However, there are some dialects in which tone can play a part in the word accent. ====Hong Kong English==== Lexical words in Hong Kong English are assigned at least one H (high) tone. Disyllabic words may have the tone pattern H-o (clóckwise), H-H (sómetímes), o-H (creáte), where \"o\" stands for tonelessness. Trisyllabic words receive any one of seven possible tone assignments H-H-H\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Chichewa tones\nContent: such as , is added, it has a tone. The tone of can spread, but the tone of an object-marker does not spread: : 'I went and helped' : 'I helped him' When the verb is monosyllabic, the tones are as follows. The tone of remains stable, but the tone of is bumped to the final: : 'I went and killed' : 'I killed him' The negative form of the tense is made with the prefix , the tone of which spreads; there is also a tone on the penultimate. The final vowel changes to -e: : 'I didn't explain' : 'I didn't help' : 'I didn't see' : 'I didn't eat' Another tense with this pattern is the Perfect Potential. This can be made with , or sometimes : : 'I would have helped'Mchombo (2004), p. 33. ====Pattern 4 (-ku-)==== In pattern 4, the tone is right-shifted or proclitic, and is heard on the syllable following the tense-marker. A typical tense with this tone pattern is the Present Continuous:Downing & Mtenje (2017), pp. 148–9. : 'I am explaining' : 'I am helping' : 'I am coming' : 'I am eating' If the verb is monosyllabic, the tone sometimes spreads backwards or regresses to the penultimate: : (also pronounced or )Mtenje (1986), p. 272.

Jennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace, said that as to the beginning of the forum, fossil fuels still get three times more money than climate solutions. At the 2021 annual meeting UNFCCC launched the 'UN Race-to- Zero Emissions Breakthroughs'. The aim of the campaign is to transform 20 sectors of the economy in order to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions. At least 20% of each sector should take specific measures, and 10 sectors should be transformed before COP 26 in Glasgow. According to the organizers, 20% is a tipping point, after which the whole sector begins to irreversibly change. ===== Coronavirus and green recovery ===== In April 2020, the forum published an article that postulates that the COVID-19 pandemic is linked to the destruction of nature. The number of emerging diseases is rising and this rise is linked to deforestation and species loss. In the article, there are multiple examples of the degradation of ecological systems caused by humans. It is also says that half of the global GDP is moderately or largely dependent on nature. The article concludes that the recovery from the pandemic should be linked to nature recovery. The forum proposed a plan for a green recovery. The plan includes advancing circular economy. Among the mentioned methods, there is green building, sustainable transport, organic farming, urban open space, renewable energy and electric vehicles. === Global Future Councils === The Network of Global Future Councils meets annually in the United Arab Emirates and\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Climate movement\nContent: deliberate action intended to critique government climate policy.

In September 2015, five climate activists known as the Delta 5 obstructed an oil train in Everett, Washington. At trial, the Delta 5 were allowed the necessity defense, that is, breaking a law in the service of preventing a greater harm. After testimony, the judge determined the grounds for the necessity defense were not met and instructed the jury to disregard testimony admitted under the necessity defense. The Delta 5 were fined for trespassing but were acquitted of more serious charges.

This theory has been criticized for the way in which the problem of migratory movements is posed and for the ideological orientation of the publishing house that published its articles, The Social Contract Press, which is an advocate of anti-immigration measures and birth control. There are major criticisms on each of the argumentative bases and different ideologies contrary to such approaches such as the Cornucopians, the advocates of the natural resource- based economy, environmentalist positions and the positions of various nations also fail to establish a consistent basis for such claims. == History == Richard C.

Philosopher and climate justice campaigner Alex Lenferna presents these three interlocking moral arguments in favor of fossil fuel divestment: # investing in fossil fuels contributes to grave, substantial, and unnecessary harm and injustice; # divesting from fossil fuels helps fulfill our moral responsibility to promote climate action; and # investing in fossil fuels morally tarnishes those who do so by making them complicit in the injustices of the fossil fuel industry. === Legal === The legal argument for divestment is the case that as the fossil fuel industry faces long-term structural risks, investors who continue to place bets on it may be breaching their fiduciary duties. In 2021, Harvard University committed to divestment from fossil fuels after facing a legal complaint asserting that its investments violated state laws. ==Effects of divestment== ===Stigmatization of fossil fuel companies=== A study by the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at the University of Oxford found that the stigmatisation of fossil fuel companies caused by divestment can \"materially increase the uncertainty surrounding the future cash flows of fossil-fuel companies.\" That, in turn, \"can lead to a permanent compression in the trading multiples – e.g., the share price to earnings (P/E) ratio of a target company.\" The study also says that: The goal of divestment campaigns is to create new global moral norms. These norms can then shift the market as a whole away from fossil fuel investments. === Financial impact === Recent evidence has suggested that, along with having social impacts, fossil fuel divestment\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Anti-nuclear movement\nContent: United States. As of 2020 expansion of biomass as fuel, which was previously praised by environmental organizations such as Greenpeace, has been criticized for environmental damage. Greenpeace advocates a reduction of fossil fuels by 50% by 2050 as well as phasing out nuclear power, contending that innovative technologies can increase energy efficiency, and suggests that by 2050 most electricity will come from renewable sources. The International Energy Agency estimates that nearly 50% of global electricity supplies will need to come from renewable energy sources in order to halve carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 and minimise climate change impacts.International Energy Agency. IEA urges governments to adopt effective policies based on key design principles to accelerate the exploitation of the large potential for renewable energy 29 September 2008. Mark Z. Jacobson says producing all new energy with wind power, solar power, and hydropower by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be \"primarily social and political, not technological or economic\". Jacobson says that energy costs with a wind, solar, water system should be similar to today's energy costs. Many have since referred to Jacobson's work to justify advocating for all 100% renewables, however, in February, 2017, a group of twenty-one scientists published a critique of Jacobson's work and found that his analysis involves \"errors, inappropriate methods and implausible assumptions\" and failed to provide \"credible evidence for rejecting the conclusions of previous analyses that point to the benefits of considering a broad portfolio of energy system options.\" Critics state that the anti-nuclear arguments overestimate the benefits of renewable energy and fail to consider land per unit of energy inefficiencies and data that claims to forecast, \"...biomass, wind, and\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Laudato si'\nContent: views that we are > witnessing \"a disturbing warming of the climatic system... due to the great > concentration of greenhouse gasses,\" and that \"there is an urgent need of a > true world political authority,\" and you have positions that it will take > more than a spoonful of the Pontiff's charm to make go down the throats of > many Americans. === From industry === A lobbyist of Arch Coal sent an email to Republican lawmakers stating the pope \"does not appear to address the tragedy of global energy poverty.\" The lobbyist argued the church should promote fossil fuels instead if he really cared about the poor. The email suggested \"talking points\" to the legislators for defending the coal industry and rejecting the arguments of the pope. The lobbyist wrote: \"Billions of people around the globe are living without electrification and suffering through untold poverty and disease as a result.\" In contrast to these arguments the encyclical argues that fossil fuels in general and coal in particular threaten the poor: Fossil fuels are a threat to prosperity for the poor. They would suffer even more in particular from sea level rise, droughts, warming and extreme weather caused by burning fossil fuels.Climate Deniers Say Nope to \"Red Pope\", The New Republic, 17 June 2015 In June 2019, in a meeting at the Vatican which climatologist Hans Joachim Schellnhuber described as one of the most significant of his 30-year career, Francis \"convinced big oil CEOs to alter their message on climate change.\" These included CEOs of ExxonMobil, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, and Chevron who pledged to avert what Francis called \"a climate emergency\" that risks \"perpetrating a brutal act of injustice towards the poor and future generations.\" Francis \"stressed the need\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Ashley Dawson\nContent: pessimistic nor prescriptive. Rather, it looks into what is already extant but made impracticable by current forms of power. The solution lies not with fortified sea walls, the book argues, but with urban movements already fighting to remake cities in a more just and equitable fashion. People's Power: Reclaiming the Energy Commons (2020) Dawson's latest work, published in 2020 by O/R Books, addresses the overwhelming scientific consensus: to avoid irreversible climate collapse, the burning of all fossil fuels will have to end in the next decade. People's Power sets out what is required to make this momentous shift. Simply replacing coal-fired power plants with for-profit solar energy farms, Dawson writes, will only maintain the untenable position that it is possible to sustain relentlessly expanding energy consumption. Putting forward the argument that energy needs to be de- commodified, Dawson's analysis centers around the idea of the global commons. Energy is a vital element in the great stock of air, water, plants, and cultural forms like language and art that are the inheritance of humanity as a whole. People's Power is a critique of a market-led transition to renewable energy, addressing the history of the early development of the electric grid in the United States, telling the story of battles for public control over power during the Great Depression. This history is used to frame accounts of contemporary campaigns, in both the United States and Europe, that eschew market fundamentalism and sclerotic state power in favor of green, democratically managed, and equitably shared forms of energy. ==Publications== ===Books=== ====Monographs==== * People’s Power: Reclaiming the Energy Commons, O/R Books 2020 *Extreme Cities: The Peril and Promise of Urban Life in the Age of Climate Change, Verso 2017 *\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Politics of climate change\nContent: go well beyond what was committed to at international level. Yet local reductions in GHG emission that such policies achieve will not slow global warming unless the overall volume of GHG emission declines across the planet. Since entering the 2020s, the feasibility of replacing energy from fossil fuel with renewable energy sources significantly increased, with some countries now generating almost all their electricity from renewables. Public awareness of the climate change threat has risen, in larger part due to social movement led by youth and visibility of the impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather events and flooding caused by sea level rise. Many surveys show a growing proportion of voters support tackling climate change as a high priority, making it easier for politicians to commit to policies that include climate action. The COVID-19 pandemic and economic recession lead to widespread calls for a \"green recovery\", with some political contexts like the European Union successfully integrating climate action into policy change. Outright climate change denial had become a much less influential force by 2019, where opposition has pivoted to strategies of encouraging delay or inaction. ==Policy debate== Like all policy debates, the political debate on climate change is fundamentally about action. Various distinct arguments underpin the politics of climate change - such as different assessments of the urgency of the threat, and on the feasibility, advantages and disadvantages of various responses. But essentially, these all relate to potential responses to climate change. The statements that form political arguments can be divided into two types: positive and normative statements. Positive statements can generally be clarified or refuted by careful definition of terms, and scientific evidence. Whereas normative statements about what one \"ought\" to do often relate at least partly to morality, and are essentially a matter of\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Construct an argument to defend the following statement: 'Alternative energy sources are critical to solving the climate crisis'\n\n[/INST]IDs: 1, 2, 5, 3</s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

The aspect can often be ambiguous; \"Tom is reading Ulysses\" may describe his current activity (it's in his hand), or the state of having started, but not yet finished, the book (it's in his bag). == Continuous and progressive in various languages == Unless otherwise indicated, the following languages treat continuous and progressive aspects the same, in which case the term continuous is used to refer to both. === English === ==== Use ==== The continuous aspect is constructed by using a form of the copula, \"to be\", together with the present participle (marked with the suffix -ing).§42.5, p. 368, A university course in English grammar, by Angela Downing and Philip Locke, reprint ed., Psychology Press, 2002, . It is generally used for actions that are occurring at the time in question, and does not focus on the larger time-scale. For example, the sentence \"Andrew was playing tennis when Jane called him.\" indicates what Andrew was doing when Jane called him, but does not indicate for how long Andrew played, nor how often he plays; for that, the simple past would suffice: \"Andrew played tennis three hours every day for several years.\" Salikoko MufweneMufwene, Salikoko S., Stativity and the Progressive, Indiana Univ. Linguistics Club, 1984. contrasts the effect of the progressive form on the meanings of action verbs versus those of lexically stative verbs: :#[I]t converts events expected to be punctual into longer- lasting, even if transient, states of affairs [e.g., \"Nancy is writing a letter\"]; :# it [con]versely converts those states of affairs expected to last long (lexical statives) to shorter-lasting / transient states of affairs [e.g., \"Tom is living with us\"]; and :# it\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Imperfective aspect\nContent: [with] no explicit reference to the beginning or to the end of his reading.\" This is the essence of the imperfective aspect. Or, to continue the quotation, \"the perfective looks at the situation from the outside, without necessarily distinguishing any of the internal structure of the situation, whereas the imperfective looks at the situation from inside, and as such is crucially concerned with the internal structure of the situation, since it can both look backwards towards the start of the situation, and look forwards to the end of the situation, and indeed it is equally appropriate if the situation is one that lasts through all time, without any beginning and without any end.\" This is why, within the past tense, perfective verbs are typically translated into English as simple past, like 'entered', whereas imperfective verbs are typically translated as 'was reading', 'used to read', and the like. (In English, it is easiest to illustrate aspect in the past tense. However, any tense is possible: Present \"John is reading as I enter\", future \"John will be reading when I enter\", etc.: In each tense, the aspectual distinction is the same.) This aspectual distinction is not inherent to the events themselves, but is decided by how the speaker views them or wishes to present them. The very same event may be described as perfective in one clause, and then imperfective in the next. For example, :\"John read that book yesterday; while he was reading it, the postman came,\" where the two forms of 'to read' refer to the same thing. In 'John read that book yesterday', however, John's reading is presented as a complete event, without further subdivision into successive temporal phases; while in 'while he was reading it', this event is opened\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Latin tenses\nContent: using 'he is said' or 'he seems' and the like, the subject of the quoted sentence is usually put into the accusative case and the construction is known as an 'accusative and infinitive'. The rule of tense is that the present infinitive is used for any action or situation which is contemporary with the main verb, the perfect for actions or situations anterior to the main verb, and the future infinitive for actions or situations later than the main verb.Gildersleeve & Lodge (1959), p. 333. An exception to this rule is the verb 'I remember', which when used of personal reminiscence (e.g. 'I remember being present') is usually followed by a present infinitive.Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 181. ====Present infinitive==== The present infinitive is used to express an action or situation simultaneous with the verb of speaking: : (Cicero)Cicero, Off. 1.30.108. :'Solon pretended that he was mad' : (Livy)Livy, 2.6.8. :'Brutus noticed that an attack was being made on him' The present infinitive used after when describing a personal reminiscence, however, refers to the past:Lewis & Short, Latin Dictionary, s.v. . : (Seneca the Elder)Seneca the Elder, 3.7.16. :'I remember going into his school when he was just about to recite a speech against Milo' ====Perfect infinitive==== In indirect statements, a perfect infinitive represents an event or a situation which occurred prior to the time of the verb of speaking.

With such an approach, a child may read \"I see a bunny,\" when in fact the last word in the sentence might read as \"rabbit.\" Using miscue analysis, this would be recorded as a miscue that nevertheless preserves the meaning of the sentence, and the child would be encouraged to continue reading, even if such a word does not match the letters in the book. A teacher critical of this approach would note that the child did not use letter-sound correspondence to decode the word, and instead used the picture or context as a way to hypothesize what word makes sense in the text. Such a teacher would work with this child to make sure that he is paying attention to the letter-sound correspondence.SEDL Balanced Reading Critics of the phonics-based perspective point out that fluent readers are those who read both effectively and efficiently. They argue that to conceptualize fluent reading as involving a word-for-word match promotes an inefficient or slow and labored approach to reading. Fluent readers do not look at individual words but rather look at chunks of words and hypothesize approximately what the sentence says, slowing down to look at the word level only when, through self-monitoring, they realize their approximations or hypotheses about what the sentence says does not make sense. In fact, fluent adult readers miscue (or read something other than what the text says) 20–40% of the time. Reading in this way, as all fluent readers do, allows for efficient reading. Effective reading involves the ability to self-monitor and apply strategies such as phonics, looking at pictures, skipping words,\n\nID: 7\nTitle: The Red Car\nContent: in tense fits and jumpy starts, putting down the book to ponder it, but not pondering long because I had to know what happened next.\" ==References== Category:English- language novels Category:2016 American novels Category:W.

This can be a real-world problem, such as computing the orbits of the planets in the solar system, or a problem of a more abstract nature, such as Hilbert's problems. It can also be a problem referring to the nature of mathematics itself, such as Russell's Paradox. ==Real-world problems== Informal \"real-world\" mathematical problems are questions related to a concrete setting, such as \"Adam has five apples and gives John three. How many has he left?\". Such questions are usually more difficult to solve than regular mathematical exercises like \"5 − 3\", even if one knows the mathematics required to solve the problem. Known as word problems, they are used in mathematics education to teach students to connect real-world situations to the abstract language of mathematics. In general, to use mathematics for solving a real-world problem, the first step is to construct a mathematical model of the problem. This involves abstraction from the details of the problem, and the modeller has to be careful not to lose essential aspects in translating the original problem into a mathematical one. After the problem has been solved in the world of mathematics, the solution must be translated back into the context of the original problem. ==Abstract problems== Abstract mathematical problems arise in all fields of mathematics. While mathematicians usually study them for their own sake, by doing so, results may be obtained that find application outside the realm of mathematics. Theoretical physics has historically been a rich source of inspiration. Some abstract problems have been rigorously proved to be unsolvable, such as squaring the circle and trisecting the angle using only the compass and straightedge constructions of\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Wheat and chessboard problem\nContent: text: thumb|By the time that the fifth square is reached on the chessboard, the board contains a total of 31, or 2^5 - 1, grains of wheat. The wheat and chessboard problem (sometimes expressed in terms of rice grains) is a mathematical problem expressed in textual form as: The problem may be solved using simple addition. With 64 squares on a chessboard, if the number of grains doubles on successive squares, then the sum of grains on all 64 squares is: and so forth for the 64 squares. The total number of grains can be shown to be 264−1 or 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (eighteen quintillion, four hundred forty-six quadrillion, seven hundred forty-four trillion, seventy-three billion, seven hundred nine million, five hundred fifty-one thousand, six hundred and fifteen, over 1.4 trillion metric tons), which is over 2,000 times the annual world production of wheat.In the period 2020-21 this was an estimated 772.64 million metric tonnes, This exercise can be used to demonstrate how quickly exponential sequences grow, as well as to introduce exponents, zero power, capital-sigma notation and geometric series. Updated for modern times using pennies and a hypothetical question such as \"Would you rather have a million dollars or a penny on day one, doubled every day until day 30?\", the formula has been used to explain compound interest. (Doubling would yield over one billion seventy three million pennies, or over 10 million dollars: 230−1=1,073,741,823). == Origins == The problem appears in different stories about the invention of chess.

The problem asks for a criterion of simplicity in mathematical proofs and the development of a proof theory with the power to prove that a given proof is the simplest possible. The 24th problem was rediscovered by German historian Rüdiger Thiele in 2000, noting that Hilbert did not include the 24th problem in the lecture presenting Hilbert's problems or any published texts. Hilbert's friends and fellow mathematicians Adolf Hurwitz and Hermann Minkowski were closely involved in the project but did not have any knowledge of this problem. This is the full text from Hilbert's notes given in Rüdiger Thiele's paper. The section was translated by Rüdiger Thiele. In 2002, Thiele and Larry Wos published an article on Hilbert's twenty-fourth problem with a discussion about its relation to various issues in automated reasoning, logic, and mathematics. ==References== #24\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Word problem (mathematics education)\nContent: their students' comprehension levels. Each of these research studies supported the finding that, in many cases, students do not often struggle with executing the mathematical procedures. Rather, the comprehension gap comes from not having a firm understanding of the connections between the math concepts and the semantics of the realistic problems. As a teacher examines a student's solution process, understanding each of the steps will help them understand how to best accommodate their specific learning needs. Another thing to address is the importance of teaching and promoting multiple solution processes. Procedural fluency is often times taught without an emphasis on conceptual and applicable comprehension. This leaves students with a gap between their mathematical understanding and their realistic problem solving skills. The ways in which teachers can best prepare for and promote this type of learning will not be discussed here. == History and culture == The modern notation that enables mathematical ideas to be expressed symbolically was developed in Europe from the sixteenth century onwards. Prior to this, all mathematical problems and solutions were written out in words; the more complicated the problem, the more laborious and convoluted the verbal explanation. Examples of word problems can be found dating back to Babylonian times. Apart from a few procedure texts for finding things like square roots, most Old Babylonian problems are couched in a language of measurement of everyday objects and activities. Students had to find lengths of canals dug, weights of stones, lengths of broken reeds, areas of fields, numbers of bricks used in a construction, and so on. Ancient Egyptian mathematics also has examples of word problems.

The altars were required to be constructed of five layers of burnt brick, with the further condition that each layer consist of 200 bricks and that no two adjacent layers have congruent arrangements of bricks.

Thus, 3^2+4^2=5^2, 8^2+15^2=17^2, 12^2+35^2=37^2 etc. which are particular cases of Diophantine equations.: \"The arithmetic content of the Śulva Sūtras consists of rules for finding Pythagorean triples such as (3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), (8, 15, 17), and (12, 35, 37). It is not certain what practical use these arithmetic rules had. The best conjecture is that they were part of religious ritual. A Hindu home was required to have three fires burning at three different altars. The three altars were to be of different shapes, but all three were to have the same area. These conditions led to certain \"Diophantine\" problems, a particular case of which is the generation of Pythagorean triples, so as to make one square integer equal to the sum of\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Mersenne prime\nContent: × 13,842,607,235,828,485,645,766,393 (26 digits) 101 253530120045...993406410751 7,432,339,208,719 (13 digits) × 341,117,531,003,194,129 (18 digits) 103 101412048018...973625643007 2,550,183,799 × 3,976,656,429,941,438,590,393 (22 digits) 109 649037107316...312041152511 745,988,807 × 870,035,986,098,720,987,332,873 (24 digits) 113 103845937170...992658440191 3,391 × 23,279 × 65,993 × 1,868,569 × 1,066,818,132,868,207 (16 digits) 131 272225893536...454145691647 263 × 10,350,794,431,055,162,386,718,619,237,468,234,569 (38 digits) The number of factors for the first 500 Mersenne numbers can be found at . ==Mersenne numbers in nature and elsewhere== In the mathematical problem Tower of Hanoi, solving a puzzle with an -disc tower requires steps, assuming no mistakes are made.

Unlike Byrne, Kenny ensured his guests were announced in advance. Other than the title, the use of an owl as the show's symbol and the traditional edition marketing toys to children and their parents, little of the original remained the same. Byrne's two catch-phrases, \"It started on The Late Late Show\", and \"one for everyone in the audience\" were dropped. The latter of these phrases has since been revived under Kenny's successor but was not much in use when Kenny was at the helm. ==== That rude interruption ==== As the 24 November 2006 edition of the show was getting underway, an intruder in a brown jacket – named as Paul Stokes from Monkstown, County Dublin – emerged from the fourth wall to confront a visibly startled Pat Kenny, who was engaged in essential preparations for the interviewing of three guests – named as You're a Star judges Thomas Black, Linda Martin, and Brendan O'Connor. The man approached Kenny. His back to the cameras, the man crouched down to bring himself closer to Kenny and said: \"Howye Pat! You're a censor! How dare you! Gay Byrne and you are ... [grunt] ... you're insufferable arseholes. You arsehole, you piece of shit, you piece of shit,\" live and uncensored as guests and audience watched on bemused. Kenny, at a loss for what to do, repeatedly uttered \"thank you, thank you\". Viewers were treated to a premature commercial break while RTÉ had the man cornered, snared, removed from the set and led from the building. When the show returned to television screens, Kenny announced to viewers, \"Sorry for that rude interruption\" and began his interview. The man was arrested but later released.\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Baby, You're a Rich Man\nContent: the song \"asks an unnamed Brian Epstein what it's like to be one of the 'beautiful people'\"; Everett adds: \"This appellation was used of both communal hippies and those who mingle with the most celebrated entertainers.\" Lennon claimed that the meaning of the song was that everybody is a rich man, saying, \"The point was stop moaning. You're a rich man and we're all rich men.\" George Harrison said the message was that all individuals are wealthy within themselves, regardless of material concerns. According to author and critic Ian MacDonald, Lennon was most likely inspired to write the verses after attending the 14 Hour Technicolor Dream, an all-night festival held at Alexandra Palace in north London on 29 April 1967. Attended by 10,000 people,Cushley, Joe. \"Dream On!\". In: . this musical and performance art event was a fundraiser for the proprietors of the underground newspaper International Times, after a police raid had forced the closure of their offices; in MacDonald's description, it marked the first large-scale coming together of Britain's \"beautiful people\". Writing in 1981 on the musical and societal developments of 1967, sociomusicologist Simon Frith said that this event was one of the \"multi-media happenings\" that reflected the new aesthetic represented by English psychedelia, whereby \"Dancing became less important than listening\" and fashion embraced vivid colours while retaining \"the mod concern for looking smart\". Frith added: \"Psychedelia was essentially elitist but the joy of psychedelic pop was that it made everyone part of the elite.\" Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). ==Composition== The song's principal key is G major in Mixolydian mode, and the time signature throughout is 4/4.

Nicoll suggests that this is \"the largest crowd mentioned anywhere in the Gospels\" but Jesus speaks \"first of all\" to his disciples, only turning to the multitude in verses 14-21, in response to a question from someone in the crowd, and again in verses 54-59. Peter asks (at verse 41) whether the parable of the faithful servant is addressed solely to the disciples or to the wider multitude (παντας, pantas: everyone).: Holman Christian Standard Bible The Jerusalem Bible notes that an alternative reading would connect the word \"first\" with the succeeding statement: First of all, be on your guard ...

After going to bed that night, David wakes up and is surprised to find the day beginning in an identical fashion to the previous day. He goes to the newsstand and asks the man what day it is, and the man says it's Monday. David realises that everyone except him is oblivious to what is going on. The same events occur again – the busker is out, girl breaks her high heel, the old lady loses her balloon, the kid steps on David's shoe and the woman in the subway entrance asks him for the time but he has again forgotten his watch. The next morning, it's Monday again and everything happens for a third time, but this time David remembers to put on his watch before leaving, he gives the busker some money, is prepared for the girl falling, rescues the balloon, dodges the kids in the subway and is able to give the woman the time, before asking her out for a drink tomorrow; she accepts his offer and they exchange numbers. The next night, Tuesday finally comes, but after getting into his car to go and pick his date up, David is shocked when he realises that the fuel gauge is empty. Panicking, he phones his date, but she is already at the restaurant. He arrives, runs inside and the scene skips to the next morning: it's Monday again, but this time David smiles.

The officers \"were so impressed and awed with what he said that they dared not take him\"; the Pharisees said they were \"deceived\" (), suggesting that none of the rulers - \"the members of the Sanhedrin, who were supposed to have control over the religious rites and doctrines of the nation - had believed. The evangelist reminds his readers that Nicodemus, \"one of them\" (i.e. one of the Sanhedrin) had met Jesus before (). Nicodemus reminds his colleagues: ====Verse 51==== :\"Does our law judge a man before it hears him and knows what he is doing?\" NKJV This is reminder of the words in : :You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike () The Sanhedrin advises Nicodemus that he should study the scriptures further: ====Verse 52==== :They answered and said to him, \"Are you also from Galilee?

But when the danger is over and the calamity has had its day, then there is all too quickly a relapse into the old ways of life, and the reconciliation coerced by the need sometimes carries within itself the seed of a deeper separation than the one that was eliminated. And even if that reconciliation casts an enhancing radiance over the period of the individual's lives, it nevertheless belongs essentially not to them but to the observation and the observer who inherits it, until the story about it is also forgotten. Even though it is beautiful to envision this, such a life is a life of temporality, is the fruit of temporality, but also the prey of temporality, and the most that can be said of it is that it was a beautiful moment.\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Aim to reduce the following sentence without changing its meaning: When he came in, he woke everyone up\n\n[/INST]IDs: </s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

The actual information in the letter (to the Pharaoh, or his post office--Bureau of Correspondence), only begins after the Reverse Side (beginning of the closing-(tablet ending) Clause 4 section), continuing from lines 57-60, and then continuing to the Left Side, for 8 lines, lines 64-71, (longer lines, due to the tallness of the tablet). The very last line (71), the Scribe writes: Enūma idû, \"Now (at this time), know!\" (\"Now, be informed!\"). # The reverse (Clauses 2 - 3), is separated by an Exclamation, (an Interjection), line 40: [line 39: \"Upon front-mine, upon (glossenkeil):back-mine!], \"I carry (bring), the Causes (intentions) (Akkadian: amatu (word, matter)),Parpola, 1971.

Finally, the pronunciation and spelling rules of foreign words are not always known, so people may not be able to hyphenate them correctly (although they can separate them at a different point, or take them to the next line altogether). ==Punctuation== ===At the end of a sentence=== Punctuation marks are added to the end of the sentence depending on its intended meaning. The exclamation mark is not only used for exclamations, but also for wishes and commands. If the sentence formally reflects one mood, but it actually refers to a different idea, the punctuation mark is selected based on the actual meaning. Punctuation marks may be repeated or combined to express an intense or mixed emotion. (For example, 'How dare you?!')AkH. 240. In case of coordinating clauses, the punctuation mark is adapted to the ending clause.AkH. 241. Subordinated clauses take a punctuation mark reflecting the main clause – except if the main clause is only symbolic, emphasizing the subordinate clause.AkH. 242. ===Between clauses=== A comma (or a colon, semicolon etc.) should be placed at the border of clauses whether or not there is a conjunction.AkH. 243. a) It also applies to cases when the clause begins with one of the conjunctions 'and' and 'or'.

Since this has to be UP, letter 16 is a U, which can be filled into the appropriate clue answer in the list of clues. Likewise, a three-letter word starting with A could be and, any, all, or even a proper name like Ann. One might need more clue answers before daring to guess which it could be. If the answer to clue B is IDLE, one could narrow down the 5/6/7 word to AND and the following word starting with JI. Some people might already begin to recognize the phrase \"Jack and Jill went up the hill.\" The numbers in the quotation are generally followed by letters corresponding to the clue answers, to aid solvers in working back and forth from the clues to the puzzle. == History == Elizabeth Kingsley is credited with inventing the puzzle for Saturday Review in 1934, under the name double- crostic. Since then, other nonce words ending in \"-crostic\" have been used. Anacrostic may be the most accurate term used, and hence most common, as it is a portmanteau of anagram and acrostic, referencing the fact that the solution is an anagram of the clue answers, and the author of the quote is hidden in the clue answers acrostically. Later Saturday Review constructors were Doris Nash Wortman, Thomas Middleton, and Barry Tunick. Thomas Middleton also produced many puzzles for Harpers Magazine. Kingsley, Wortman, and Middleton created additional puzzles for The New York Times from 1952–1999, but not more than one every other week. Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon took over the bi-weekly setting duties for the NYT in 1999. A similar puzzle, called a Trans-O-Gram, by Svend Petersen, and later, Kem Putney, appeared in National Review from\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Cryptic crossword\nContent: AFFIDAVIT if four letters were added to the start. * 'Foreign Languages', involving non-English words as solutions, e.g. \"English writer, but understood by all Frenchmen [4]\", solution: MAIS * 'Literary References', involving references to books, e.g. \"Procedures followed by Romans [4]\", solution: ACTS * 'Outsides', the converse of a Hidden Word clue, e.g. \"Cavalrymen disheartened in Normandy [4]\", solution: CAEN Initial or Final letter clues are also mentioned in this chapter, to be used 'When the setter is in real desperation'. == Clueing techniques == === Combination clues === \"Combination clues\" employ more than one method of wordplay; this is particularly common for longer grid entries. For example: :Illustrious baron returns in pit (9) The answer is HONORABLE. \"Baron\" \"returns\", or is reversed, and put inside \"pit\" or hole, to make honorable, or \"illustrious\". In this example, the clue uses a combination of Reversal and Hidden clue types: :Cruel to turn part of Internet torrid (6) The answer to this clue is ROTTEN. The phrase \"to turn\" indicates \"to reverse,\" and \"part of\" suggests a piece of \"Internet torrid\". === Misleading clues === To make clues more difficult, cryptic constructors will frequently use traditional indicator words in a misleading manner. *A cryptic crossword on the back page of the Daily Telegraph on 14 March 2012 included the answer ANALYSIS, whose clue was \"Close study of broken nails, say (8)\": \"say\" in cryptic crossword clues normally means \"a word pronounced the same as\" or \"for example\", but here it is part of an anagram. * Daily Telegraph back page, 8 November 2012: \"Drunk compiler's admitted boob (5)\" means \"Means 'drunk', MY contains ERR, has 5 letters\", = MERRY.\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Dutton Speedwords\nContent: example: the affix -a indicates an unfavorable connotation to the root-word; thus, bixy = kill, bixya = murder. Some compounds appear fanciful, or at least not immediately transparent, such as ky + luf (eat + air) to mean \"picnic\". Grammatical features include the use of single letters (as opposed to verb conjugations) to indicate tense; the letter r indicates future tense and y indicates past. Thus, j sa = I know, j ysa = I knew, j r sa = I will know. Nouns and verbs have the same form (as do many English words: the light, I light, etc.) as do adverbs and adjectives (bel = \"beautiful\" and \"beautifully\"). Compounds follow a headnoun-modifier sequence, as in ca + dor (room + sleep) = bedroom. ==Phonology and orthography== Dutton orthography is irregular. It is combined with phonology below. ===Stress=== Stress is on the first syllable (first vowel), except that the opposite suffix -o is always stressed, and the verbal prefixes u- (present participle) and y- (past tense) are never stressed.Dutton Speedwords: Pronunciation, page 1. Compiled by Raymond Brown from \"Dutton World Speedwords\" (3rd ed. 1946) and \"Dutton Double-Speed Words Companion to Text\" (3rd ed. 1946). ===Vowels=== Vowels are rather similar to Latin. When a vowel occurs at the end of a morpheme or before another vowel, it is long, otherwise, it is usually short (though some suffixes shorten a preceding morpheme-final vowel).Raymond Brown Dutton Speedwords: Pronunciation, pages 1 & 2.

To produce this sentence, a space is deleted between \"a\" and \"galling\", two spaces are added into \"instate\" and the dash is replaced by a comma. In his analysis of Printer's Devilry clues, Ximenes noted that it was a popular type, arguably easier than the standard cryptic but with the potential to be made more difficult by concealing the position of the break. A difficult Printer's Devilry clue can therefore involve substantial changes to the structure of the sentence, not just the addition of the clue word, as in: which must be significantly adjusted to produce the sentence: \"When he was dancing at the center, I could not see Jose Limon as ticket expenses there were too high.\" with the clue word MONASTIC. However, the letters of the clued word always appear in order, and they always appear consecutively – the sentence is only ever broken in a single place. In Printer's Devilry clues, the surface can be ungrammatical or nonsensical, but the complete sentence should always be logical and natural. A common mistake when setting Printer's Devilry clues is to do the reverse and contrive a sentence which reads naturally on its surface, but which when combined with the answer produces a sentence that is not idiomatic and therefore is impossible to guess. An example of this, criticized by Ximenes, is: The answer to this clue is MORALE, producing the sentence \"Do all the lines of tram or a level crossing always lack supervision?\" – a sentence Ximenes described as \"so unnatural that the clue would be almost insoluble\". It is also considered poor form for the break to appear at the beginning or end of a word.\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Khasi language\nContent: after a vowel), which appears between the agreement and the tense particle. There is a special past negation particle /shym/ in the past which replaces the ordinary past /la/ (Roberts 1891): Khasi English Um ju thoh. He doesn't write. Um shym thoh. He didn't write. Um nym thoh He won't write. Um dei ban thoh He shouldn't write. ====Copulas==== The copula is an ordinary verb in Khasi, as in the following sentence: ====Causative verbs==== Khasi has a morphological causative /pn-/ (Rabel 1961). (This is spelled pyn in Roberts (1891)): Base verb Gloss Causative verb Gloss hiar come down pynhiar let down, export tip know pyntip make known phuh blossom pynphuh beautify ïaid walk pyn-ïaid drive, put agoing jot torn pyn-jot destroy poi arrive pyn-poi deliver ===Sentences=== ====Word order==== Word order in simple sentences is subject–verb–object (SVO): However, VSO order is also found, especially after certain initial particles, like hangta 'then' (Rabel 1961). ====Case marking==== Sometimes the object is preceded by a particle ya (spelled ia in Roberts 1891). Roberts says \"ia, 'to', 'for', 'against' implies direct and immediate relation.

(Kratzer, 2009: 202 (27)) (23a) and (23b) are determined to be grammatically correct, but an issue arises from the bound variable standpoint. Due to a third person inflective, the bound variable readings for (23a) and (23b) should be considered impossible, but as Kratzer states, they are considered to be correct. This can be attributed to how the third person inflection is not supposed to be associated with a possessive first or second person bound variable pronoun. Expanding slightly from (23), Kratzer gives the example: (24) We are the only people who brush our teeth. (Kratzer, 2009: 202 (28)) In this example, the v, what normally binds the pronoun, has all phi features bound to itself from the start. Kratzer describes predication as the subject pronoun that eventually becomes a relative pronoun. Predication, in (24) adopts the phi features from v. Kratzer predicts that the merging of DPs to a specifier position would only happen when the DPs are without phi features. In the event that a DP adopts phi features from v from predication, then there should be a clear distinction. Kratzer illustrates this point by providing the following example: (25) *Nina v respects myself. (Kratzer, 2009: 205 (20)) (25) is deemed ungrammatical because it has a third person and first person feature. The third person feature, \"Nina\", marks the sentence as ungrammatical due to how it specifies a person. English does not accept third person features in sentences when first person features already exist. German, however, does, which is explained in the German section below. Leading off of (25)'s inability to have third and first person features, Kratzer builds on the\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Georgian grammar\nContent: person, o or a for the third person; in the subjunctive, the suffixal nominal marker is the same for all persons, generally e or o or, less frequently, a. The aorist intransitive form avashene, 'I built', has the structure, a-v-a-shen-Ø-e, characterized by preverb -a- and weak suffixal nominal marker -e-. ====Auxiliary verb==== The auxiliary verb is only used in the present indicative and perfective screeves of indirect verbs and in the perfective screeve of transitive verbs when the direct object is first or second person(s) (these are situations, where the m- set is used for the subject of the verb, and, therefore, v- set is used to indicate the direct object). The auxiliary verb is the same verb as to be in present screeve. The verb to be for the singular persons are: Me var (\"I am\"), Shen xar (\"You are\") and Is aris/ars (as an auxiliary verb shortened version a is used) (\"he/she/it is\"). For example, miq'vars means \"I love him/her\" (the s at the end of the verb indicating that it is the third person whom the speaker loves). In order to say \"I love you\", the s at the end has to be replaced with xar (as, now, the direct object is the second person): miq'var-xar (\"I love you\"), mq'varebi-a (\"I have loved him/her\"). ====Plural marker==== Depending on which set of nominal markers is employed, the appropriate plural suffix is added. It can refer to either subject or object. An example of referring to objects would be miq'var-xar-t (\"I love you (plural)\") and miq'var-a-n' (\"I love them\"). ===Auxiliary verbs=== In addition to the possible auxiliary verb in\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Tîrî language\nContent: for the optional nominal subject toni). Although the third person pronoun can be used for non-human entities (while the first and second person pronouns generally only refer to humans), speakers tend to use it in its singular form even when there is more than one referent, as seen below (Osumi, 1995, p. 39). As indicated in the table above, Tîrî pronouns change form depending on whether they are being used as subjective, objective or free forms, the latter encompassing a variety of other pronoun usages, such as pronouns that have been topicalized and occur sentence-initially, as seen below (Osumi, 1995, pp. 39–40). While they are classified as pronouns as they fill the subject pronoun slot, Tîrî's two impersonal pronouns show less flexibility than personal pronouns. They do not show any distinction for person or number and occur only in their respective forms of hêrrê and va, are unable to appear anywhere other than the subject pronoun position (the first element in the verb phrase), and are never followed by a nominal subject (Osumi, 1995, p. 41). Speakers use hêrrê to refer to any number of unspecified entities when they do not wish to or are not concerned with specifying a referent as the agent of an action (Osumi, 1995, p. 41), as in the example below. This contrasts with the below example, which is more likely to be used by a speaker who wishes to imply that a particular person has committed the same act (Osumi, 1995, p. 42). While hêrrê is typically used to refer to humans, the impersonal pronoun va is used similarly to refer to non-human referents, though this is not always the case (Osumi, 1995, p. 43).

There are three of them: (first person), (second person), and (third person). If a stem has an underlying initial vowel, a is inserted after the prefix, and before this and other stem-initial consonants a is inserted. Sometimes, this contracts with a stem-initial to except when the would be phonetically shortened via rule U-4a. Examples include: ('I get up from lying') versus ('he gets up'). Two roots with initial extend the syllable with when adding prefixes; these roots are ('there') and ('so many'), e.g. ('that is where we live [our lives]') from the animate intransitive stem .Goddard, Ives, 1979, p. 76 Prefixes are mutually exclusive and are selected based on the following rule: if one of the participants is second person, the second person prefix is used; if not, if one of the participants is the first person, then the first person prefix is used; if none of these applies, other forms, if they take a prefix, take the third person prefix. This is the well-known Algonquian 2-1-3 precedence rule.Goddard, Ives, 1979, p. 78 ====Suffixes==== Suffixes are grouped into eight positional classes. These are: *Theme *# Theme signs *Thematic affixes * * Diminutive and pejorative *# Obviative and plural *# Negative; imperative modes *Desinences (inflectional suffixes) *# * Central endings *# Aspect *# Peripheral endings *# Mode =====First position===== The first position (theme signs) is filled only for transitive verbs and help describe the relationship between the two participants by indicating\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Simple present\nContent: Play _s_ *Enjoy – Enjoy _s_ *Say – Say _s_ A special situation happens with the verb to have in which the letters ve are omitted before adding s.

The copula verb be has irregular forms: am (first person singular), is (third person singular), and are (second person singular and all persons plural). The modal verbs (can, must, etc.) have only a single form, with no addition of -s for the third person singular. The above refers to the indicative mood of the simple present; for the formation and use of the subjunctive mood, see English subjunctive. (The defective verb beware has no simple present indicative, although it can be used in the subjunctive.) The conjugation of the simple present is given below, using the verb to write as an example.

Tesnière states that the third person marker does not tell the listener/reader anything about the subject, because there is no concept of an actant (or agent) attached to it. Figure 1 shows a phrase structure tree of the English sentence It rains. While it does not appear to contribute any meaning to the sentence, it is still syntactically required to be present. For example, an English speaker cannot simply say, Rains, because attempting to pronounce the sentence without the pleonastic it renders the sentence ungrammatical. This ungrammatical instance arises from a violation of the Extended Projection Principle (EPP) which states that all tensed phrases must have a subject. In Figure 1, it occupies the subject (or, specifier) position of the tense phrase (TP), satisfying the EPP, and making the sentence It rains grammatical. === Avalent verbs in null-subject languages === Avalency is more clearly demonstrated in pro-drop languages, which do not grammatically require a dummy pronoun as English does. * Examples in Latin: # Pluit. Meaning, \"It rains,\" or \"It is raining.\" # Ningit. Meaning, \"It snows,\" or \"It is snowing.\" * Examples in Italian: # Piove. Meaning, \"It rains,\" or \"It is raining.\" # Nevica. Meaning, \"It snows,\" or \"It is snowing.\" * Examples in Spanish: # llueve. Meaning, \"It rains,\" or \"It is raining.\" # Nieva. Meaning, \"It snows,\" or \"It is snowing.\" Because none of the above examples have an overt, pronounced subject, they all appear to violate the EPP. However, null-subject languages allow phrases without an overt subject if the subject can easily be deduced by the context.

The forms of these suffixes differ by auxiliary verb. ====Pronominal prefixes==== As in Warndarrang and other related languages, a different pronominal prefix is added to the verb for each combination of subject and object. For example, a verb with a second-person singular subject and a first-person exclusive dual object would take the prefix but the person-person exclusive dual subject with a third-person dual object would take the prefix . Within the second-person subject, third-person object paradigm, there are also different pronouns for imperative and non-imperative verbs. There are extremely complicated rules, with many exceptions, for generating these pronouns. When the third person or third person subject/third person object category is marked, the additional prefix is added to the complex. ===Syntax=== ====Word order==== Within a noun phrase (NP) or verb complex, word order is almost completely fixed.

For verbs, the negative particles must immediately precede the verb complex, and within the complex the order of the morphemes is strictly set. Within the clause, however, the order of the NPs, verb complexes, and adverbs is free. The first element is typically considered to be the most important element. If the first element is not a verb complex, the main verb complex commonly but not always assumes the second position; there appears to be no difference in meaning between\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Rewrite the following sentence in the third person: 'I am anxious'\n\n[/INST]IDs: 5, 4</s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

An order is typically made either through a restaurant or grocer's website or mobile app, or through a food ordering company. The delivered items can include entrees, sides, drinks, desserts, or grocery items and are typically delivered in boxes or bags. The delivery person will normally drive a car, but in bigger cities where homes and restaurants are closer together, they may use bikes or motorized scooters. Recently, online food delivery through third-party companies have become a growing industry and caused a \"delivery revolution.\" Nascent technologies, such as autonomous vehicles have also been used to complete deliveries. Customers can, depending on the delivery company, choose to pay online or in person, with cash or card. A flat rate delivery fee is often charged with what the customer has bought. Sometimes no delivery fees are charged depending upon the situation. Tips are often customary for food delivery service. Contactless delivery may also be an option. Other aspects of food delivery include catering and wholesale food service deliveries to restaurants, cafeterias, health care facilities, and caterers by foodservice distributors. ==History== The first food delivery service was for naengmyeon (cold noodle) in Korea, recorded in 1768. Haejang-guk (hangover soup) was also delivered for the yangban in the 1800s. Advertisement for food delivery and catering also appeared in the newspaper in 1906. ==Types== === Meal delivery === A meal delivery service (MDS) is a service that sends customers fresh or frozen, prepared meals delivered to their homes and offices. These services individually package pre-portioned meals to assist with eating a healthy diet. These services cook and prepare meals for customers.

In Korea, the food delivery services include Baedal Minjok, Yogiyo, Uber Eats, and CoupangEats. Korea online food delivery industry is expected to reach $10 billion by 2020. In the GCC Region, after Uber Eats decided to close its operations in Middle Eastern markets, major food delivery services include now Careem Now, Deliveroo, Talabat and Noon Food since 2021. === Software platforms === As the number of restaurant food delivery systems has increased, so have the logistical challenges of tracking online orders—restaurants using delivery services usually must have each service's tablet or iPad to receive orders, which then must be transferred into the restaurant's own point-of- sales system. To streamline this, software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies have emerged to integrate the online ordering, billing and dispatching of restaurant food orders. In addition to providing online ordering software for restaurant chains (e.g. Applebee’s, Cheesecake Factory, Chipotle, Shake Shack), these SaaS companies' digital platforms also provide data analysis that these restaurants use for medium- and long-term planning. The application created for food delivery have positive influences on the performance and profits of the restaurant. Besides, it also can help to save money and time for both restaurant and customers. Moreover, COVID-19 has brought food delivery service to another level. The demand for online food delivery services increased significantly before the COVID-19 pandemic, which amounts to the US$31 billion. Researcher Ahn also mentions that the revenue in the online food delivery segment increased from $76.195 billion in 2017 and aims to achieve $136.431 billion in 2022; the population of food delivery application users is expected to reach 965.8 million people by 2024. ==Working conditions== In May 2022, workers in two of\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Take-out\nContent: 1, 2008. A restaurant can either maintain its own delivery personnel or use third parties who contract with restaurants to not only deliver food orders but also assist in marketing and providing order-taking technology. The field has seen rapid growth since the late 2000s with the spread of the smart phones and apps enabling customers to order from their mobile devices. According to a study cited the New York Times, as of 2019, three companies account for nearly 80 percent of the US restaurant food delivery market: GrubHub, Uber Eats and DoorDash. Competition for market share has been fierce, with smaller competitors either being bought out or closing down. Amazon Restaurants announced in June 2019 that it was closing its restaurant food delivery service to concentrate on grocery delivery. Some businesses offer a guarantee to deliver within a predetermined period of time, with late deliveries not charged for. For example, Domino's Pizza had a commercial campaign in the 1980s and early 1990s for its pizza delivery service which promised \"30 minutes or it's free\". This was discontinued in the United States in 1993 due to the number of lawsuits arising from accidents caused by hurried delivery drivers. ==Packaging== Take- out food is packaged in paper, paperboard, corrugated fiberboard, plastic, or foam food containers. One common container is the oyster pail, a folded, waxed or plastic coated, paperboard container. The oyster pail was quickly adopted, especially in the West, for \"Chinese takeout\". In Britain old newspapers were traditionally used for wrapping fish and chips until this was banned for health reasons in the 1980s. Many people are nostalgic for this traditional wrapping; some modern fish and chip shops wrap their food in faux-newspaper, food-safe paper printed to look like a newspaper.

In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, DoorDash announced it had \"stockpiled tens of thousands of gloves and bottles of hand sanitizer\" and was offering them to delivery drivers for free. The company also said it had changed the default drop-off option to contactless delivery. That month, DoorDash became the fastest growing food delivery service. In October 2020, the company launched its \"Reopen for Delivery\" program to have brick-and-mortar restaurants that have closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic partner with local ghost kitchen operators to offer food delivery- and pick-up-only service. In November 2020, DoorDash announced the opening of its first physical restaurant location, partnering up with Bay Area restaurant Burma Bites to offer delivery and pick- up orders.

This way, the restaurant could easily modify the prices without going to the expense of reprinting the paper menus. A similar tactic continued to be used in the 2000s with certain items that are sensitive to changing supply, fuel costs, and so on: the use of the term \"market price\" or \"Please ask the server\" instead of stating the price. This allows restaurants to modify the price of lobster, fresh fish and other foods subject to rapid changes in cost. The latest trend in menus is to display them on handheld tablets; customers can browse through these and look at the photographs of the dishes. ==Writing style== The main categories within a typical menu in the US are appetizers, \"side orders and à la carte\", entrées, desserts and beverages. Sides and à la carte may include such items as soups, salads, and dips. There may be special age-restricted sections for \"seniors\" or for children, presenting smaller portions at lower prices. Any of these sections may be pulled out as a separate menu, such as desserts and/or beverages, or a wine list. A children's menu may also be presented as a placemat with games and puzzles, to help keep children entertained. Menus can provide other useful information to diners. Some menus describe the chef's or proprietor's food philosophy, the chef's résumé (British: CV), or the mission statement of the restaurant. Menus often present a restaurant's policies about ID checks for alcohol, lost items, or gratuities for larger parties.

The menu's listing of regions of origin for each dish drew appreciation from one critic for the level of detail, but was seen by another as revealing a lack of authentic Italian devotion to a single region. The same critic also derided etched panels with Italian wording that \"like a Peckham greengrocer, boast a rogue apostrophe\". In 2012 the menu was described as \"changing daily\". Noted were the pork and foie gras sausages, and sanguinaccio dolce, a dessert of chocolate pudding flavoured with pig's blood. Bocca di Lupo's early critical popularity, which also included winning a Michelin Guide \"Bib Gourmand\" award,[2] was described by some critics as having negatively impacted the experience, with tables very hard to book and prices increasing from the bargain levels that had contributed to the initial success – in 2010 it was described by The Observer as \"not cheap, but worth every penny.\" The restaurant went on to win the \"Best Wine List\" award in Tatler magazine's 2013 restaurant awards.[1] == Site and layout == thumb|right|Diners can sit at the bar and watch the chefs at work.

The type of company and the technology used determine factors that change prices and costs. For example, it may be necessary to reprint the latest menu, contact the distributor, to change the price list and the prices of items on the shelf. Menu costs in some industries may be small, but the scale may influence business decisions about whether to reprice. A 1997 study published by Harvard College and MIT used data from 5 multistore supermarket chains to investigate the magnitude of menu costs. They considered the cost of: # Labour to change shelf prices # Printing and delivering new labels # Mistakes during the changeover process # Supervision during the changeover process Results of the study showed that the menu cost was on average $105,887 per year, per store. This figure comprised 0.7% of revenue, 32.5% of net margins and $0.52/price change. Subsequently in order for updating prices to be beneficial the profitability of an item needed to decrease by more than 32.5%. The study concluded that menu costs have a magnitude large enough to be of macroeconomic significance. == Factors influencing menu costs == Pricing regulation Pricing and regulatory requirements such as requiring individual price stickers on each item can increase menu costs by increasing the time needed to update prices in stores physically. The study summarised above, which detailed the magnitude of menu costs in multistore supermarkets, also investigated the impact of pricing laws that required individual price tags to be placed on items. The study found that menu costs were 2.5 times higher for the store impacted by the local pricing requirements. Further, firms not subject to the requirements were found\n\nID: 3\nTitle: The Square (restaurant)\nContent: Independent in May 1997 described the Mayfair relocation as \"very ritzy\" and \"appeal[ing] to the smart, international crowd\". Rogers further said that the interior design of the newer location at the time contained \"parquet flooring, variously coloured walls—some rendered, some white, one a rusty red—some colourful modern art, ugly brown upholstered chairs, one vaguely art-deco column and, as a centrepiece, a large bevelled mirror doing nothing in particular.\" Mark Bittman of The New York Times in February 2001 noted the cuisine being \"simply modern\" more than \"modern French\", \"large abstract oil paintings\", and tables with flowers on top and covered by \"skirts of dark crepe velvet\" and \"crisp linen\". In the mid-2000s, the interior design was refurbished. ==2016: The Square sold to Abela== When the financial crisis of 2007–2008 occurred, The Square's lunch business had been affected for a long time. After multimillion-pound Mayfair eateries Sexy Fish and Park Chinois opened in 2015, rents and premium rates increased for offices and other restaurants around the area, including The Square and Hibiscus.

But, the restaurant does not have a model footprint and so each location can be tailored to the available space. Restaurant interiors are designed in a modern style with indirect lighting and decorated with locally produced photo murals. Customers order at a central counter and food is brought to them in stainless steel baskets. They are given silverware to eat with in place of plasticware. Restaurants are designed with a social feel in mind, and feature high tables and low tables, booths, and an outdoor patio. The company has a tailored music soundtrack for restaurants as well. An internal team designed and built the initial soundtracks around the restaurant's \"Smash, sizzle, savor\" theme. As Smashburger began to grow, management brought in outside consultants in 2011 to develop a new program for music that would better fit a \"modern, high-energy\" restaurant concept, although it retains a family-friendly vibe. Music in restaurants was subsequently designed with a target audience of 32 years old, avoiding overly bubblegum or electronic music and rooted in contemporary pop, allowing its sound track to remain mainstream but allowing for older classics as well as new and emerging international music. International locations feature an American-inspired soundtrack as well. The company also has employee incentives for stores it owns directly which it credits with boosting morale, including paying $9 an hour in 2011, above the then-minimum wage of $7.25. Bonuses are awarded for certain milestones as well. Cooks are awarded extra money for filling orders in under six minutes, while managers are given bonuses for meeting monthly revenue goals and gaining positive customer reviews. ===Awards=== The restaurant chain was named \"America's Most Promising Company\" in 2011 by Forbes.\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Menu cost\nContent: text: In economics, the menu cost is a cost that a firm incurs due to changing its prices. It is one microeconomic explanation of the price-stickiness of the macroeconomy put by New Keynesian economists. The term originated from the cost when restaurants print new menus to change the prices of items. However economists have extended its meaning to include the costs of changing prices more generally. Menu costs can be broadly classed into costs associated with informing the consumer, planning for and deciding on a price change and the impact of consumers potential reluctance to buy at the new price. Examples of menu costs include updating computer systems, re-tagging items, changing signage, printing new menus, mistake costs and hiring consultants to develop new pricing strategies. At the same time, companies can reduce menu costs by developing intelligent pricing strategies, thereby reducing the need for changes. == Menu costs and nominal rigidity == Menu costs are the costs incurred by the business when it changes the prices it offers customers. A typical example is a restaurant that has to reprint the new menu when it needs to change the prices of its in-store goods. So, menu costs are one factor that can contribute to nominal rigidity. Firms are faced with the decision to alter prices frequently as a result of changes in the general price level, product costs, market structure, regulation and demand level. Despite frequent market changes, businesses may be hesitant to update prices to reflect these changes due to menu costs. If the menu cost outweighs the expected increase in revenue associated with the price change firms would prefer to exist in disequilibrium and stay at the original price level. When the nominal price level remains constant despite market change is said that there is\n\nID: 6\nTitle: ZZ's Clam Bar\nContent: said it \"celebrates\" Umbertos Clam House, another Manhattan seafood restaurant founded in 1972 and located in Little Italy.

In 2022, Major Food Group opened a Miami restaurant, ZZ's Sushi Bar, which has been referred to as \"a hybrid version of [...] ZZ's Clam Bar and a sushi and private members club.\" ===Adam Platt ejection=== Early in the restaurant's history, critic Adam Platt was ejected while eating by \"a very large bouncer\". Platt had previously given Carbone a one-star review, and assumed the ejection was \"retribution\" for doing so. Platt has contrasted Major Food Group's apparently retaliatory reaction with a softer one from Danny Meyer after Platt wrote a negative review of Meyer's restaurant Blue Smoke. Meyer approached Platt after the review was published and informed him the negative review was \"very helpful\". Major Food Group's senior staff has not commented on Platt's removal. ==Reviews and accolades== ===Reviews=== Critics have noted the restaurant's high prices. Ryan Sutton, in a review for Bloomberg, praised the food and the cocktails by Waugh, but stressed the costs of both. As a counterpoint to the higher-cost items, Sutton highlighted the market-price clams as \"one way to enjoy a Champagne setting on a beer budget\". Despite an overall positive review, Sutton did fault the restaurant for not replacing utensils between courses given the costs. Alan Richman, writing for GQ, echoed this concern, writing the restaurant needed to \"upgrade the experience\" given the expensive offerings. ===Accolades=== The restaurant earned a Michelin star for the first time in 2014, which it retained\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Harry's Bar (London)\nContent: in the event we fail to meet them.

Repeat buyers and users are also useful for further reasons, as they are the source of “word of mouth” advertising. Studies have shown that customer satisfaction with a brand leads to more purchases, from both the same and new customers. A satisfied customer expresses their enjoyment in the product, or even shows a friend the product and has them try it out, and a dissatisfied customer may speak against a product or not mention it at all. Of course, the core consumer is the main spreader of the company’s brand name, and the more they use and like what they consume, the more those that surround them will gain interest and then potentially become customers themselves. == Shifting of Customer Priority == Content consumers eventually become fully saturated, and no longer desire the product to be upgraded as it had been before. This customer begins to lose interest, and stops becoming a regular buyer for the business. As a company tends to drift upmarket, many lower-end customers do not keep up. These customers then tend to turn to other companies for alternative products or services that have features they value over the original company's usual upgrades. The original company also allows these customers to leave, as they have shifted priority to higher-end customers. As old core customers lose priority, the company that sold to them does not fight very hard to keep them. Fighting for the old customers could risk losing the new, more profitable people. This allows new start-up businesses to start moving upstream by interesting and attaining these customers for themselves, as the start-up goes through the same cycles that the established company\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Marketing communications\nContent: responses are immediate action such as dialing the commercials number to order a product advertised on television. One of the main goals of communication is receiving appropriate receiver responses, feedback closes the loop in the communications flow and lets the sender monitor how the intended message is being decoded and received. To achieve this goal one can ask indirectly or directly for the response, or assist the receiver in giving the response. Receiving feedback can be more difficult for parties that advertise through the channels of mass media, because advertisers are not in direct contact with their customers so other methods must be obtained to determine how their messages have been received. While the critical form of feedback happens through sales, it is often hard to show a direct relationship between advertising and purchase behavior. So marketers; visit stores, check coupon redemption, use reply cards and listen to customer inquiries to achieve feedback. Once a significant amount of feedback/response study has been gathered advertisers would then have enough information to determine reasons for success or failure in the communication process and from there they can make appropriate adjustments. ===Opinion leaders and opinion formers=== Opinion leaders are consumers who have large influence over the purchasing behavior of other consumers.Opinion Leaders. Business Dictionary. These can be peers or celebrities, and often represent a \"desired state\" in the eye of the influenced consumer. By following the consumption patterns of opinion leaders, consumers aspire to achieve a similar status or lifestyle, and project a similar image. Because of this, opinion leaders are powerful factors in marketing communications. Having opinion leaders endorse a brand can increase brand awareness and sales. Due to this, large companies pay highly influential celebrities to endorse their products.

Touch points can be either physical or a human interaction between a brand and the consumer which influence customer decision-making process during pre-purchase, purchase and post-purchase. There are many ways in which a customer may interact with a business. Interactions occur through direct customer service exchanges, a company website, the point of purchase environment and product packaging or performance. These all contribute to consumer perceptions of a particular brand. For instance, the service-scape of a purchase touch point such as a retail store can influence the perception of quality and service through lighting and layout or other sensory touch points, for example, smell. Fast fashion retailers such as Topshop maintain a white store interior and exterior which is perceived as luxurious. Likewise, the higher price point and packaging of Ferrero Rocher may communicate sophistication and better quality. Visual appearance can have a significant effect on purchase decision, companies such as Coke a Cola and Pepsi provide a free fridge to distributors to control how products are displayed at the point of purchase. ==Multiplier effect== While boarding a United Airlines flight, Dave Carroll saw baggage handlers on the tarmac damage his Taylor guitar.

The complexity of consumer decisions in itself can result in ego depletion. This, in turn, could impact any subsequent decisions consumers must make. When consumers are depleted, they are more likely to become passive, and make more impulsive decisions that may not fall in line with their true values. Consumers are faced with choices of different price ranges and product qualities in the market. Having many options can make consumers feel overwhelmed, causing ego depletion. Advertisements telling consumers how they deserve and must have a product can cause mental fatigue and frustration, leading people to give in to buying a product. Fatigue and frustration can also stem from deals with specific requirements on ways to purchase a product, along with spending effort on deciding which store has the best deals or trying to get to the store. People will then be led to buy the high priced or cheapest product. Consumers who have low self-control are susceptible to be more invested in obtaining product of a high status. These same consumers are more likely to be more motivated, persistent, and pay more for a product. This will lead consumers to have a sense of empowerment; they will feel in control again and feel as though they are overcoming their ego depleted states. It can also lead them to purchasing a brand that has a high status. The consumer might feel that the brand be more beneficial and secure with the product. ==Relief== In a recent experiment, it was shown that inducing a positive mood can buffer the impairing effects of ego depletion on subsequent performance. Positive mood was induced by getting individuals to watch comedy videos or by giving them a surprise gift. Positive mood seemed to allow people to recover faster from ego depletion and\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Hard sell\nContent: in such a way to buy a product how a seller predicts that they will. The ultimate goal of this type of selling is to create a mood or image that will appeal to the buyer and make them want to spend their money on a product, all without the buyer realizing that this is occurring. Persistence is not as involved in a soft sell as it is in a hard sell. ==Principles used== === Numbers game === A very large volume is needed to run hard sell. Even with small probabilities of success, enough sales can be achieved by attempting conversion on large customers base to sustain the operation or even generate profits. This is especially useful when selling recurring purchases, such as subscriptions, warranty, or MLM products, because one sale will lead to recurring purchases. === Emotional triggers === Most purchases are analytical decisions, and hence, require time to collect data about comparable products, make comparisons to fit individual needs and find budget to finalize a purchase. Hard sell attempts to bypass all that by using emotional triggers, such as appealing to personal aspirations, creating artificial scarcity, applying compliance principles, and exploiting cognitive biases or fallacies. === Information asymmetry === Hard sell leverages information asymmetry, such as by avoiding comparisons with competitors, by delaying disclosures, by deflecting customer questions for clarity or information, or by limiting access to resources such as time (to decide), internet, or friends feedback (e.g. by running only in-person sales). Such information asymmetry is used as a leverage to make the sale seem more appealing than it actually is. === Targeting === Some segments of the population are especially susceptible to hard selling, such as elderly people, unemployed, students, and minority groups. ==Advantages== The\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Personal selling\nContent: sales presentation. :Approach–Refers to the stage when the salesperson initially meets with the customer. Since first contact leaves an impression on the buyer, professional conduct, including attire, a handshake, and eye contact, is advised. :Need assessment–An important component of the sales presentation is the assessment of the customer's needs. Salespeople should evaluate the customer based on the need for the product. Sales representatives typically ask questions designed to reveal the prospective client's current situation, the source of any problems, the impact of the problems, the benefits of the solution, the client's prior experience with the brand or the category, the prospect's general level of interest and readiness to purchase. In the case of corporate clients, it may be necessary to ascertain any limitations on the prospect's authority to make a purchase (e.g. financial restrictions). :Sales presentation–Once the salesperson knows the needs, he or she is ready for the presentation. Sales representatives often follow the AIDA model, which allows them to lead the prospect through the standard stages of the purchase decision process. The steps in the AIDA process are to grab the customer’s Attention, ignite Interest, create Desire, and inspire Action (AIDA). The salesperson can do this through product demonstrations and presentations that show the features, advantages and benefits of the product. : Handling objections–After the presentation, the sales person must be ready to handle any objections. Customers who are interested will voice their concerns, usually in one of four ways. They might question the price or value of the product, dismiss the product/service as inadequate, avoid making a commitment to buy, or refuse because of an unknown factor. Salespeople should do their best to anticipate objections and respectfully respond to them. :Closing–When the sales person feels that the\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Personal selling\nContent: large initial requestCialdini, R.

These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps had to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements \"bubble\" up to the top of the list. This simple algorithm performs poorly in real world use and is used primarily as an educational tool. More efficient algorithms such as quicksort, timsort, or merge sort are used by the sorting libraries built into popular programming languages such as Python and Java. However, if parallel processing is allowed, bubble sort sorts in O(n) time, making it considerably faster than parallel implementations of insertion sort or selection sort which do not parallelize as effectively. ==History== The earliest description of the Bubble sort algorithm was in a 1956 paper by mathematician and actuary Edward Harry Friend, Sorting on electronic computer systems, published in the third issue of the third volume of the Journal of the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) , as a \"Sorting exchange algorithm\". Friend described the fundamentals of the algorithm, and, although initially his paper went unnoticed, some years later, it was rediscovered by many computer scientists, including Kenneth E. Iverson who coined its current name. ==Analysis== === Performance === Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of items being sorted. Most practical sorting algorithms have substantially better worst-case or average complexity, often O(n\\log n). Even other O(n^2) sorting algorithms, such as insertion sort,\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Bubble sort\nContent: algorithms, algorithms like insertion sort are usually considerably more efficient. Due to its simplicity, bubble sort is often used to introduce the concept of an algorithm, or a sorting algorithm, to introductory computer science students. However, some researchers such as Owen Astrachan have gone to great lengths to disparage bubble sort and its continued popularity in computer science education, recommending that it no longer even be taught. The Jargon File, which famously calls bogosort \"the archetypical [sic] perversely awful algorithm\", also calls bubble sort \"the generic bad algorithm\". Donald Knuth, in The Art of Computer Programming, concluded that \"the bubble sort seems to have nothing to recommend it, except a catchy name and the fact that it leads to some interesting theoretical problems\", some of which he then discusses.Donald Knuth. The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 3: Sorting and Searching, Second Edition. Addison-Wesley, 1998. . Pages 106–110 of section 5.2.2: Sorting by Exchanging. \"[A]lthough the techniques used in the calculations [to analyze the bubble sort] are instructive, the results are disappointing since they tell us that the bubble sort isn't really very good at all. Compared to straight insertion […], bubble sorting requires a more complicated program and takes about twice as long!\" (Quote from the first edition, 1973.) Bubble sort is asymptotically equivalent in running time to insertion sort in the worst case, but the two algorithms differ greatly in the number of swaps necessary. Experimental results such as those of Astrachan have also shown that insertion sort performs considerably better even on random lists. For these reasons many modern algorithm textbooks avoid using the bubble sort algorithm in favor of insertion sort. Bubble sort also interacts poorly with modern CPU hardware.

The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output. Formally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions: # The output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order). # The output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input. For optimum efficiency, the input data should be stored in a data structure which allows random access rather than one that allows only sequential access. == History and concepts == From the beginning of computing, the sorting problem has attracted a great deal of research, perhaps due to the complexity of solving it efficiently despite its simple, familiar statement. Among the authors of early sorting algorithms around 1951 was Betty Holberton, who worked on ENIAC and UNIVAC. Bubble sort was analyzed as early as 1956. Asymptotically optimal algorithms have been known since the mid-20th century new algorithms are still being invented, with the widely used Timsort dating to 2002, and the library sort being first published in 2006. Comparison sorting algorithms have a fundamental requirement of Ω(n log n) comparisons (some input sequences will require a multiple of n log n comparisons, where n is the number of elements in the array to be sorted). Algorithms not based on comparisons, such as counting sort, can have better performance.\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Sorting algorithm\nContent: 2n time. ==== Comb sort ==== Comb sort is a relatively simple sorting algorithm based on bubble sort and originally designed by Włodzimierz Dobosiewicz in 1980. It was later rediscovered and popularized by Stephen Lacey and Richard Box with a Byte Magazine article published in April 1991. The basic idea is to eliminate turtles, or small values near the end of the list, since in a bubble sort these slow the sorting down tremendously. (Rabbits, large values around the beginning of the list, do not pose a problem in bubble sort) It accomplishes this by initially swapping elements that are a certain distance from one another in the array, rather than only swapping elements if they are adjacent to one another, and then shrinking the chosen distance until it is operating as a normal bubble sort. Thus, if Shellsort can be thought of as a generalized version of insertion sort that swaps elements spaced a certain distance away from one another, comb sort can be thought of as the same generalization applied to bubble sort. ==== Exchange sort ==== Exchange sort is sometimes confused with bubble sort, although the algorithms are in fact distinct. Exchange sort works by comparing the first element with all elements above it, swapping where needed, thereby guaranteeing that the first element is correct for the final sort order; it then proceeds to do the same for the second element, and so on. It lacks the advantage which bubble sort has of detecting in one pass if the list is already sorted, but it can be faster than bubble sort by a constant factor (one less pass over the data to be sorted; half as many total comparisons) in worst case situations. Like any simple O(n2) sort it can be reasonably\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Sorting algorithm\nContent: n). This, combined with the fact that Shellsort is in-place, only needs a relatively small amount of code, and does not require use of the call stack, makes it is useful in situations where memory is at a premium, such as in embedded systems and operating system kernels. === Bubble sort and variants === Bubble sort, and variants such as the Comb sort and cocktail sort, are simple, highly inefficient sorting algorithms. They are frequently seen in introductory texts due to ease of analysis, but they are rarely used in practice. ==== Bubble sort ==== Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. The algorithm starts at the beginning of the data set. It compares the first two elements, and if the first is greater than the second, it swaps them. It continues doing this for each pair of adjacent elements to the end of the data set. It then starts again with the first two elements, repeating until no swaps have occurred on the last pass. This algorithm's average time and worst-case performance is O(n2), so it is rarely used to sort large, unordered data sets. Bubble sort can be used to sort a small number of items (where its asymptotic inefficiency is not a high penalty). Bubble sort can also be used efficiently on a list of any length that is nearly sorted (that is, the elements are not significantly out of place). For example, if any number of elements are out of place by only one position (e.g. 0123546789 and 1032547698), bubble sort's exchange will get them in order on the first pass, the second pass will find all elements in order, so the sort will take only 2n time. ==== Comb sort ==== Comb sort\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Bubble sort\nContent: poorly with modern CPU hardware. It produces at least twice as many writes as insertion sort, twice as many cache misses, and asymptotically more branch mispredictions. Experiments by Astrachan sorting strings in Java show bubble sort to be roughly one-fifth as fast as an insertion sort and 70% as fast as a selection sort. In computer graphics bubble sort is popular for its capability to detect a very small error (like swap of just two elements) in almost-sorted arrays and fix it with just linear complexity (2n). For example, it is used in a polygon filling algorithm, where bounding lines are sorted by their x coordinate at a specific scan line (a line parallel to the x axis) and with incrementing y their order changes (two elements are swapped) only at intersections of two lines. Bubble sort is a stable sort algorithm, like insertion sort. == Variations == * Odd–even sort is a parallel version of bubble sort, for message passing systems. * Passes can be from right to left, rather than left to right. This is more efficient for lists with unsorted items added to the end. * Cocktail shaker sort alternates leftwards and rightwards passes. == Debate over name == Bubble sort has been occasionally referred to as a \"sinking sort\". For example, Donald Knuth describes the insertion of values at or towards their desired location as letting \"[the value] settle to its proper level\", and that \"this method of sorting has sometimes been called the sifting or sinking technique. This debate is perpetuated by the ease with which one may consider this algorithm from two different but equally valid perspectives: # The larger values might be regarded as heavier and therefore be seen to progressively sink to the bottom\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Comb sort\nContent: text: Comb sort is a relatively simple sorting algorithm originally designed by Włodzimierz Dobosiewicz and Artur Borowy in 1980, later rediscovered (and given the name \"Combsort\") by Stephen Lacey and Richard Box in 1991. Entire magazine available at archive.org. Comb sort improves on bubble sort in the same way that Shellsort improves on insertion sort. nist.gov's \"diminishing increment sort\" definition mentions the term 'comb sort' as visualizing iterative passes of the data, \"where the teeth of a comb touch;\" the former term is linked to Don Knuth. ==Algorithm== The basic idea is to eliminate turtles, or small values near the end of the list, since in a bubble sort these slow the sorting down tremendously. Rabbits, large values around the beginning of the list, do not pose a problem in bubble sort. In bubble sort, when any two elements are compared, they always have a gap (distance from each other) of 1. The basic idea of comb sort is that the gap can be much more than 1. The inner loop of bubble sort, which does the actual swap, is modified such that the gap between swapped elements goes down (for each iteration of outer loop) in steps of a \"shrink factor\" k: . The gap starts out as the length of the list n being sorted divided by the shrink factor k (generally 1.3; see below) and one pass of the aforementioned modified bubble sort is applied with that gap. Then the gap is divided by the shrink factor again, the list is sorted with this new gap, and the process repeats until the gap is 1. At this point, comb sort continues using a gap of 1 until the list is fully sorted.

Humans used bows and arrows for hunting and aggression long before recorded history, and the practice was common to many prehistoric cultures. They were important weapons of war from ancient history until the early modern period, where they were rendered increasingly obsolete by the development of the more powerful and accurate firearms. Today, bows and arrows are mostly used for hunting and sports. Archery is the art, practice, or skill of using bows to shoot arrows.Paterson Encyclopaedia of Archery p. 17 A person who shoots arrows with a bow is called a bowman or an archer. Someone who makes bows is known as a bowyer,Paterson Encyclopaedia of Archery p. 31 someone who makes arrows is a fletcher,Paterson Encyclopaedia of Archery p. 56 and someone who manufactures metal arrowheads is an arrowsmith.Paterson Encyclopaedia of Archery p. 20 == Basic design and use == thumb|upright|Drawing a bow, from a 1908 archery manual A bow consists of a semi-rigid but elastic arc with a high-tensile bowstring joining the ends of the two limbs of the bow. An arrow is a projectile with a pointed tip and a long shaft with stabilizer fins (fletching) towards the back, with a narrow notch (nock) at the very end to contact the bowstring. To load an arrow for shooting (nocking an arrow), the archer places an arrow across the middle of the bow with the bowstring in the arrow's nock. To shoot, the archer holds the bow at its center with one hand and pulls back (draws) the arrow and the bowstring with the other (typically the dominant hand).

Also their tests revealed that an arrow fired from a traditional bow wobbles in the air enough that it will not hit the end of the arrow straight. ===Guns Fired Underwater=== It has already been shown that, in some cases, bullets become non-lethal when fired into water, but what happens when the whole gun is fired under water? Myth statement Status Notes A modern firearm can be fired if completely submerged in water. (From Bulletproof Water) Confirmed All of the firearms (a 9mm, a .357, a 12-gauge shotgun, and a .30-06) could be discharged under water, but the bullets lose velocity rapidly and are rendered less than lethal beyond a meter. (The entire gun had to be completely submerged in water—all pockets of air must be removed—to prevent a possible explosion when fired.) Furthermore, the break-barrel shotgun (a relatively old design) destroyed itself when fired under water. Finally, the water pressure might cause the spent cartridge casing to fail to leave the chamber and effectively reduce the gun to a one-shot deal. Obviously, revolvers would not have this problem, as they do not eject their spent casings after each shot. ==Episode 52 – \"Mind Control\"== * Original air date: May 3, 2006 ===Painting With Explosives=== This myth originated from the episode \"Do-It-Yourself, Mr. Bean\" of the British comedy series Mr. Bean starring Rowan Atkinson.

The compound bow was invented by Holless Wilbur Allen in the 1960s (a US patent was filed in 1966 and granted in 1969) and it has become the most widely used type of bow for all forms of archery in North America. Mechanically drawn bows typically have a stock or other mounting, such as the crossbow. Crossbows typically have shorter draw lengths compared to compound bows. Because of this, heavier draw weights are required to achieve the same energy transfer to the arrow. These mechanically drawn bows also have devices to hold the tension when the bow is fully drawn. They are not limited by the strength of a single archer and larger varieties have been used as siege engines. ===Types of arrows and fletchings=== The most common form of arrow consists of a shaft, with an arrowhead at the front end, and fletchings and a nock at the other end. Arrows across time and history have normally been carried in a container known as a quiver, which can take many different forms. Shafts of arrows are typically composed of solid wood, bamboo, fiberglass, aluminium alloy, carbon fiber, or composite materials. Wooden arrows are prone to warping. Fiberglass arrows are brittle, but can be produced to uniform specifications easily. Aluminium shafts were a very popular high-performance choice in the latter half of the 20th century, due to their straightness, lighter weight, and subsequently higher speed and flatter trajectories. Carbon fiber arrows became popular in the 1990s because they are very light, flying even faster and flatter than aluminium arrows. Today, the most popular arrows at tournaments and Olympic events are made of composite materials. The arrowhead is the primary functional component of the arrow.

Selfbows are made from a single piece of wood. While there is great variety in the construction details of bows (both historic and modern), all bows consist of a string attached to elastic limbs that store mechanical energy imparted by the user drawing the string. Bows may be broadly split into two categories: those drawn by pulling the string directly and those that use a mechanism to pull the string. Directly drawn bows may be further divided based upon differences in the method of limb construction, notable examples being self bows, laminated bows and composite bows. Bows can also be classified by the bow shape of the limbs when unstrung; in contrast to traditional European straight bows, a recurve bow and some types of longbow have tips that curve away from the archer when the bow is unstrung.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency recommends actions such as (in order of preference): source reduction, feeding hungry people, feeding animals, industrial use, and composting, all of which are preferred to the least desirable options, incineration and landfill. === Source reduction === Reduce the amount of food that is generated and potentially wasted. At an individual level, food waste results from choices made during the planning, shopping, storing, preparing, cooking, eating, and discarding of food. Individuals can for example make shopping lists so they do not buy more food than they really need, to reduce food waste at the household level. They can also buy smaller amounts of produce more frequently, to avoid spoilage at home. Studies of food waste behaviors suggest that another reason that people waste food is misconceptions about date labeling, so learning about food labels can help to reduce waste. A useful tactic is to use visual prompts such as brightly colored tape to mark foods that need to be used soon. Reminders that cue people about what to use can be particularly helpful in large households. Source reduction is often advocated at all stages of the Food supply chain, and could be achieved via Prevention and valorisation pathways for human consumption, such as food donations, or upcycling and re-processing into new food products. This can also include measures to overcome current hinders that limits the food potential per produced unit of food, such as unharvested \"ugly\" vegetables at farms, \"best-before\" dates at retail level, or under utilized by-products from food processing.

Retrieved 2022-04-06. == Prevention and valorisation == In 2022 United Nations Biodiversity Conference nations adopted an agreement for preserving biodiversity, including a commitment to reduce food waste by 50% by the year 2030. According to FAO's The State of Food and Agriculture 2019, the case for reducing food loss and waste includes gains that society can reap but which individual actors may not take into account, namely: (i) increased productivity and economic growth; (ii) improved food security and nutrition; and (iii) mitigation of environmental impacts of losing and wasting food, in particular terms of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG emissions as well as lowering pressure on land and water resources. The last two societal gains, in particular, are typically seen as externalities of reducing food loss and waste. Response to the problem of food waste at all social levels has varied hugely, including campaigns from advisory and environmental groups, and concentrated media attention on the subject. As suggested by the food waste hierarchy, prevention and reuse pathways for human consumption have the highest priority levels for food waste treatment. The general approach to food waste reduction comprise two main pathways: prevention and valorisation. Prevention of food waste infers all actions that reduce food production and ultimately prevent food from being produced in vain, such as food donations or re-processing into new food products. Valorisation on the other hand comprise actions that recover the materials, nutrients or energy in food waste, for instance by producing animal feed, fuel or energy. Multiple studies have studied the environmental benefits of food waste prevention measures, including food donations, recovery of unharvested vegetables for re-use in food production, re-processing of surplus bread for beer production, and producing chutney or juice from leftovers.

Food waste is defined as all parts of food, inedible and edible, created before, during, and after food processing, production, and consumption. Greenhouse gases, especially methane can be reduced by food waste recycling. Food waste recycling can also alleviate the saturation of landfill sites in Hong Kong. ==Background== ===Current situation of food waste in Hong Kong=== The amount of food waste accounts for 38% of the municipal solid waste in Hong Kong. According to the statistics published by the Environmental Protection Department, Hong Kong generates approximately 3,648 tonnes of food waste each day. About one-third of the food waste comes from the commercial and industrial sectors while the remaining part is from households. The situation of food waste disposal in Hong Kong has become more serious in recent years. The amount of food waste from the commercial and industry sectors increased from 400 tonnes in 2002 to 1033 tonnes in 2014. ===Three steps of food waste recycling in Hong Kong=== Food waste recycling typically involves a three-step strategy that includes separation, collection and recycling. These three steps are interdependent and equally important in efficiently generating useful resources from food waste recycling. ====Separation==== The collected food waste is separated into two categories: pre-consumer food waste and post-consumer food waste. Pre-consumer food waste includes animal food waste, vegetable food waste, and waste from industrially- processed food. Post-consumer food waste refers to leftover food, such as from an unfinished restaurant order. Source separation also involves removing any food packaging and utensils. ====Collection==== Food waste vehicles, managed by the government, collect and deliver food waste to governmental recycling\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Food loss and waste\nContent: chutney or juice from leftovers. Food waste can also be used to produce multiple high-value products, such as a fish oil substitute for food or feed use via marine micro algae, without compromising the ability to produce energy via biogas. The general consensus currently suggest that reducing food waste by either prevention or valorisation, for human consumption, infers higher environmental benefits compared to the lower priority levels, such as energy production or disposal. Multiple private enterprises have developed hardware and software solutions dealing mainly with the prevention of food waste within foodservice production facilities (contract catering, hotels & resorts, cruise ships, casinos etc.), by gathering quantitative and qualitative data about the specific food waste, helping chefs and managers reduce food waste by up to 70% by improving and optimising their workflows and menus. === Food rescue === There are multiple initiatives that rescue food that would otherwise not be consumed by humans anymore. The food can come from supermarkets, restaurants or private households for example. Such initiatives are: * food banks, * online platforms like Too Good To Go and Olio, * public foodsharing shelves like those from foodsharing.de and * dumpster diving. === Consumer marketing === One way of dealing with food waste is to reduce its creation. Consumers can reduce spoilage by planning their food shopping, avoiding potentially wasteful spontaneous purchases, and storing foods properly (and also preventing a too large buildup of perishable stock). Widespread educational campaigns have been shown to be an effective way to reduce food waste. A British campaign called \"Love Food, Hate Waste\" has raised awareness about preventative measures to address food waste for consumers. Through advertisements, information on food storage and preparation and in-store education, the UK observed a 21% decrease in avoidable\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Food rescue\nContent: by-products from food processing.

The Flashfood app, designed by Josh Domingues, is being used in Canada and the United States to keep edible food from becoming waste. It notifies users of deeply discounted groceries, encouraging shoppers to buy soon-to-be-remaindered foods. They can make their purchase online, then go by the store to pick up their food. Initially focusing on restaurants and bakeries, the Too Good to Go app enables customers to buy discounted Surprise Bags of food.

USDA data from 2010 shows that 26% of fish, meat, poultry were thrown away at the retail and consumer level. Since then meat production has increased by more than 10%. Data scientist Harish Sethu says this means that billions of animals are raised and slaughtered only to end up in a landfill. ==Impact on the environment== thumb|Food waste is responsible for 6% of global greenhouse gas emissions Empirical evidence at the global level on the environmental footprints for major commodity groups suggests that, if the aim is to reduce land use, the primary focus should be on meat and animal products, which account for 60 percent of the land footprint associated with food loss and waste. If the aim is to target water scarcity, cereals and pulses make the largest contribution (more than 70 percent), followed by fruits and vegetables. In terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with food loss and waste, the biggest contribution is again from cereals and pulses (more than 60 percent), followed by roots, tubers and oil-bearing crops. However, the environmental footprint for different commodities also varies across regions and countries, due, among other things, to differences in crop yields and production techniques. According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, the reduction of food waste would be beneficial for improving availability of resources such as \"water, land-use, energy consumption\" and the overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.Accelerating the transition in the context of 2 sustainable development, Ch 17 in \"Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change\". www.ipcc.ch.

Methane is about 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide in terms of its global warming potential. Additionally, food production, transportation, and processing require energy, and when food is wasted, the energy used to produce it is also wasted. This leads to unnecessary energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The emissions generated by food waste in Barcelona has been calculated to be 520,700 tonnes of CO2 emissions, approximately the emissions equivalent to 20,300 cars throughout their useful life. * Land use: The production of food requires land, and when food is wasted, the land used to grow it is also wasted. This leads to deforestation, soil erosion, and loss of biodiversity. * Water use: Food production also requires water, and when food is wasted, the water used to grow it is also wasted. This can lead to water scarcity and depletion of freshwater resources. Reducing food waste can help to mitigate these environmental impacts, as it can conserve resources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote sustainable food consumption. This can be achieved through various strategies, such as improving food storage and handling practices, promoting sustainable agriculture and production methods, and changing consumer behavior through education and awareness-raising campaigns. == Current initiatives == The Spanish government has implemented several initiatives to tackle food waste, such as the establishment of the Circular Economy Spanish Strategy which aims to reduce food waste by 50% by 2030.

In the 2022 United Nations Biodiversity Conference nations agree to reduce food waste by 50% by the year 2030. == Definition == thumb|upright=1.6|A conceptual framework for food loss and waste (FLW) Food loss and waste occurs at all stages of the food supply chain – production, processing, sales, and consumption. Definitions of what constitutes food loss versus food waste or what parts of foods (i.e., inedible parts) exit the food supply chain are considered lost or wasted vary. Terms are often defined on a situational basis (as is the case more generally with definitions of waste). Professional bodies, including international organizations, state governments, and secretariats may use their own definitions. ===United Nations=== The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations defines food loss and waste as the decrease in quantity or quality of food along the food supply chain. Within this framework, UN Agencies distinguish loss and waste at two different stages in the process: *Food loss occurs along the food supply chain from harvest/slaughter/catch up to, but not including, the sales level *Food waste occurs at the retail and consumption level. Important components of this definition include: * Food redirected to nonfood chains (including animal feed, compost, or recovery to bioenergy) is not counted as food loss\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Generate a list of methods to reduce food waste.\n\n[/INST]IDs: 0, 1</s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

According to the SMMT, \"There are two clear states – a vehicle is either assisted with a driver being supported by technology or automated where the technology is effectively and safely replacing the driver.\"SMMT publishes guiding principles for marketing automated vehicles, SMMT, 22 novembre 2021 === Autonomous vs. automated === Autonomous means self- governing. Many historical projects related to vehicle automation have been automated (made automatic) subject to a heavy reliance on artificial aids in their environment, such as magnetic strips. Autonomous control implies satisfactory performance under significant uncertainties in the environment, and the ability to compensate for system failures without external intervention. One approach is to implement communication networks both in the immediate vicinity (for collision avoidance) and farther away (for congestion management). Such outside influences in the decision process reduce an individual vehicle's autonomy, while still not requiring human intervention. , most commercial projects focused on automated vehicles that did not communicate with other vehicles or with an enveloping management regime. Euro NCAP defines autonomous in \"Autonomous Emergency Braking\" as: \"the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident\", which\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Impact of self-driving cars\nContent: will increase productivity, and housing affordability, as well as reclaim land used for parking. However, self-driving cars will cause greater energy use, traffic congestion and sprawl. Automated cars could reduce labor costs; relieve travelers from driving and navigation chores, thereby replacing behind-the- wheel commuting hours with more time for leisure or work; and also would lift constraints on occupant ability to drive, distracted and texting while driving, intoxicated, prone to seizures, or otherwise impaired. For the young, the elderly, people with disabilities, and low-income citizens, automated cars could provide enhanced mobility. The removal of the steering wheel—along with the remaining driver interface and the requirement for any occupant to assume a forward-facing position—would give the interior of the cabin greater ergonomic flexibility. Large vehicles, such as motorhomes, would attain appreciably enhanced ease of use. The elderly and persons with disabilities (such as persons who are hearing-impaired, vision-impaired, mobility-impaired, or cognitively-impaired) are potential beneficiaries of adoption of autonomous vehicles; however, the extent to which such populations gain greater mobility from the adoption of AV technology depends on the specific designs and regulations adopted.Ashley Jalsey III, Driverless cars promise far greater mobility for the elderly and people with disabilities, Washington Post (23 November 2017).Henry Claypool, Amitai Bin-Nun & Jeffrey Gerlach, Self-Driving Cars: The Impact on People with Disabilities (January 2017), Ruderman Family Foundation/Securing America's Future Energy. Children and teens, who are not able to drive a vehicle themselves in case of student transport, would also benefit of the introduction of autonomous cars. Daycares and schools are able to come up with automated pick-up and drop-off systems by car in addition to walking, cycling and busing, causing a decrease of reliance on parents and childcare workers.\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Impact of self-driving cars\nContent: implying that the larger battery requirement might not be as large as previously assumed. == Self-parking and parking space == === Self-parking === A study conducted by AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety found that drivers did not trust self-parking technology, even though the systems outperformed drivers with a backup camera. The study tested self-parking systems in a variety of vehicles (Lincoln MKC, Mercedes-Benz ML400 4Matic, Cadillac CTS-V Sport, BMW i3 and Jeep Cherokee Limited) and found that self-parking cars hit the curb 81% fewer times, used 47% fewer manoeuvres and parked 10% faster than drivers. Yet, only 25% of those surveyed said they would trust this technology. === Parking space === Manually driven vehicles are reported to be used only 4–5% of the time, and being parked and unused for the remaining 95–96% of the time. Autonomous taxis could, on the other hand, be used continuously after they have reached their destination. This could dramatically reduce the need for parking space. For example, in Los Angeles a 2015 study found 14% of the land is used for parking alone, equivalent to some . This combined with the potential reduced need for road space due to improved traffic flow, could free up large amounts of land in urban areas, which could then be used for parks, recreational areas, buildings, among other uses; making cities more livable. Besides this, privately owned self-driving cars, also capable of self-parking would provide another advantage: the ability to drop off and pick up passengers even in places where parking is prohibited. This would benefit park and ride facilities. == Cybersecurity == === Privacy === The vehicles' increased awareness could aid the police by reporting on illegal passenger behaviour, while possibly enabling other crimes, such\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Self-driving car\nContent: car that drives itself\". The Union of Concerned Scientists states that self-driving cars are \"cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take control to safely operate the vehicle. Also known as autonomous or \"driver-less\" cars, they combine sensors and software to control, navigate, and drive the vehicle.\" The British Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018 law defines a vehicle as \"driving itself\" if the vehicle \"is operating in a mode in which it is not being controlled, and does not need to be monitored, by an individual\". Another British definition assumes: \"Self-driving vehicles are vehicles that can safely and lawfully drive themselves.\" === SAE classification === A classification system with six levels – ranging from fully manual to fully automated systems – was published in 2014 by standardization body SAE International as J3016, Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems; the details are revised periodically. This classification is based on the amount of driver intervention and attentiveness required, rather than the vehicle's capabilities, although these are loosely related. In the United States in 2013, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) had released its original formal classification system. After SAE updated its classification in 2016, called J3016_201609,SAE International NHTSA adopted the SAE standard, and SAE classification became widely accepted. The SAE standard plays a major role but it has certain limitations. === Levels of driving automation === In SAE's automation level definitions, \"driving mode\" means \"a type of driving scenario with characteristic dynamic driving task requirements (e.g., expressway merging, high speed cruising, low speed traffic jam, closed-campus operations, etc.)\" * : The automated system issues warnings and may momentarily intervene but has no sustained vehicle control. *\n\nID: 5\nTitle: History of self-driving cars\nContent: announced plans to deploy 100 XC90 self-driving cars to test them in everyday driving conditions in China in 2017. Also in April 2016, the carmaker announced plans to begin a trial in London in 2017 with 100 Volvo XC90 plug-in hybrids fitted with Drive Me technology. The XC90s will be leased to everyday users, and the self-driving cars will log every journey, passing on that data to Thatcham Research, which will conduct a thorough analysis to examine how the car behaves in everyday situations as well as understand how other road users and the car's occupants respond to autonomous driving decisions made by the car. The first known fatal accident involving a vehicle being driven by itself took place in Williston, Florida on 7 May 2016 while a Tesla Model S electric car was engaged in Autopilot mode. The driver was killed in a crash with a large 18-wheel tractor-trailer. On 28 June 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a formal investigation into the accident working with the Florida Highway Patrol. According to the NHTSA, preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when the tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the Tesla at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway, and the car failed to apply the brakes. The car continued to travel after passing under the truck's trailer. The NHTSA's preliminary evaluation was opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use at the time of the crash, which involves a population of an estimated 25,000 Model S cars. In August 2016, Singapore launched the first self-driving taxi service (as a pilot), provided by an autonomous vehicle startup company called nuTonomy. In September 2016, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) adopted the SAE\n\nID: 6\nTitle: CityCar\nContent: architect Frank Gehry. General Motors has been responsible for much of the support and resources as well as the MIT Design Lab, Smart Cities Group. Research developed for the concept vehicle is divided into four main groups: CityCar, Athlete, Zero Car, and Transology.Transology at archinode.com ==Mobility on demand== The CityCar concept was developed as the cleanest, economical and sustainable solution to meet the demand for personal urban mobility in densely populated cities, and was designed for cities as opposed to the conventional automobile, which shaped the city layout and landscape during the 20th century. The main purpose of the car is to supplement public transportation systems, providing mobility for the first and last part of a trip, which means that ideal deployment would be in urban car sharing fleets located near public transport hubs. This operational scheme is called \"Mobility on Demand\" system. The CityCar could also be used for short trips in government and corporate urban fleets to provide services such as mail and commercial deliveries, police patrolling, etc. ==Design concept== The CityCar concept was designed as an all-electric four-wheel ultra-small vehicle (USV) for two passengers, and drive-by-wire driver interface. Each wheel is independently digitally controlled, with its own wheel motor, which enables them to move in different direction and speed, and allows the wheels to rotate up to 120 degrees, allowing for turning on a dime or 0-degree turn radius, thus giving the vehicle more precise maneuverability. This feature makes the CityCar suitable for urban conditions, as it can perform sideways motions for parallel parking, and O-turns instead of the conventional three-point turns. Chapter 4, pp. 65-72. This wheel arrangement allows entry and exit at four points around the vehicle's perimeter. The CityCar was designed for front entry,\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Self-driving car\nContent: roads. Researchers at their Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have developed a new system, called MapLite, which allows self-driving cars to drive on roads that they have never been on before, without using 3D maps. The system combines the GPS position of the vehicle, a \"sparse topological map\" such as OpenStreetMap (i.e. having 2D features of the roads only), and a series of sensors that observe the road conditions. Sensor fusion Control systems on automated cars may use sensor fusion, which is an approach that integrates information from a variety of sensors on the car to produce a more consistent, accurate, and useful view of the environment. Self-driving cars tend to use a combination of cameras, LiDAR sensors, and radar sensors in order to enhance performance and ensure the safety of the passenger and other drivers on the road. An increased consistency in self-driving performance prevents accidents that may occur because of one faulty sensor. Path planning Path planning is a computational problem to find a sequence of valid configurations that moves the object from the source to destination. Self- driving cars rely on path planning technology in order to follow the rules of traffic and prevent accidents from occurring. The large scale path of the vehicle can be determined by using a voronoi diagram, an occupancy grid mapping, or with a driving corridors algorithm. A driving corridors algorithm allows the vehicle to locate and drive within open free space that is bounded by lanes or barriers. While these algorithms work in a simple situation, path planning has not been proven to be effective in a complex scenario. Two techniques used for path planning are graph-based search and variational-based optimization techniques. Graph-based techniques can make harder decisions such as how to pass another\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Propose an idea for a self-driving car.\n\n[/INST]IDs: 0, 2, 6</s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

That is, it concerns two-dimensional sample points with one independent variable and one dependent variable (conventionally, the x and y coordinates in a Cartesian coordinate system) and finds a linear function (a non-vertical straight line) that, as accurately as possible, predicts the dependent variable values as a function of the independent variable. The adjective simple refers to the fact that the outcome variable is related to a single predictor. It is common to make the additional stipulation that the ordinary least squares (OLS) method should be used: the accuracy of each predicted value is measured by its squared residual (vertical distance between the point of the data set and the fitted line), and the goal is to make the sum of these squared deviations as small as possible. Other regression methods that can be used in place of ordinary least squares include least absolute deviations (minimizing the sum of absolute values of residuals) and the Theil–Sen estimator (which chooses a line whose slope is the median of the slopes determined by pairs of sample points). Deming regression (total least squares) also finds a line that fits a set of two-dimensional sample points, but (unlike ordinary least squares, least absolute deviations, and median slope regression) it is not really an instance of simple linear regression, because it does not separate the coordinates into one dependent and one independent variable and could potentially return a vertical line as its fit. The remainder of the article assumes an ordinary least squares regression. In this case, the slope of the fitted line is equal to the correlation between and corrected by the ratio of standard deviations of these variables. The intercept of\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Linear regression\nContent: and explanatory variables. After developing such a model, if additional values of the explanatory variables are collected without an accompanying response value, the fitted model can be used to make a prediction of the response. * If the goal is to explain variation in the response variable that can be attributed to variation in the explanatory variables, linear regression analysis can be applied to quantify the strength of the relationship between the response and the explanatory variables, and in particular to determine whether some explanatory variables may have no linear relationship with the response at all, or to identify which subsets of explanatory variables may contain redundant information about the response. Linear regression models are often fitted using the least squares approach, but they may also be fitted in other ways, such as by minimizing the \"lack of fit\" in some other norm (as with least absolute deviations regression), or by minimizing a penalized version of the least squares cost function as in ridge regression (L2-norm penalty) and lasso (L1-norm penalty). Conversely, the least squares approach can be used to fit models that are not linear models. Thus, although the terms \"least squares\" and \"linear model\" are closely linked, they are not synonymous. ==Formulation== thumb|In linear regression, the observations (red) are assumed to be the result of random deviations (green) from an underlying relationship (blue) between a dependent variable (y) and an independent variable (x). Given a data set \\\\{y_i,\\, x_{i1}, \\ldots, x_{ip}\\\\}_{i=1}^n of n statistical units, a linear regression model assumes that the relationship between the dependent variable y and the vector of regressors x is linear. This relationship is modeled through a disturbance term or error variable ε — an unobserved\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Linear model\nContent: text: In statistics, the term linear model is used in different ways according to the context. The most common occurrence is in connection with regression models and the term is often taken as synonymous with linear regression model. However, the term is also used in time series analysis with a different meaning. In each case, the designation \"linear\" is used to identify a subclass of models for which substantial reduction in the complexity of the related statistical theory is possible. ==Linear regression models== For the regression case, the statistical model is as follows. Given a (random) sample (Y_i, X_{i1}, \\ldots, X_{ip}), \\, i = 1, \\ldots, n the relation between the observations Y_i and the independent variables X_{ij} is formulated as :Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\phi_1(X_{i1}) + \\cdots + \\beta_p \\phi_p(X_{ip}) + \\varepsilon_i \\qquad i = 1, \\ldots, n where \\phi_1, \\ldots, \\phi_p may be nonlinear functions. In the above, the quantities \\varepsilon_i are random variables representing errors in the relationship. The \"linear\" part of the designation relates to the appearance of the regression coefficients, \\beta_j in a linear way in the above relationship. Alternatively, one may say that the predicted values corresponding to the above model, namely :\\hat{Y}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\phi_1(X_{i1}) + \\cdots + \\beta_p \\phi_p(X_{ip}) \\qquad (i = 1, \\ldots, n), are linear functions of the \\beta_j. Given that estimation is undertaken on the basis of a least squares analysis, estimates of the unknown parameters \\beta_j are determined by minimising a sum of squares function :S = \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\left(Y_i - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1 \\phi_1(X_{i1}) - \\cdots -\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Proper linear model\nContent: text: In statistics, a proper linear model is a linear regression model in which the weights given to the predictor variables are chosen in such a way as to optimize the relationship between the prediction and the criterion. Simple regression analysis is the most common example of a proper linear model. Unit- weighted regression is the most common example of an improper linear model. == Bibliography == * Category:Regression models\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Linear regression\nContent: suffer from the mentioned deficiency. * Least-angle regression is an estimation procedure for linear regression models that was developed to handle high- dimensional covariate vectors, potentially with more covariates than observations. *The Theil–Sen estimator is a simple robust estimation technique that chooses the slope of the fit line to be the median of the slopes of the lines through pairs of sample points. It has similar statistical efficiency properties to simple linear regression but is much less sensitive to outliers.; . * Other robust estimation techniques, including the α-trimmed mean approach, and L-, M-, S-, and R-estimators have been introduced. ==Applications== Linear regression is widely used in biological, behavioral and social sciences to describe possible relationships between variables. It ranks as one of the most important tools used in these disciplines. ===Trend line=== A trend line represents a trend, the long-term movement in time series data after other components have been accounted for. It tells whether a particular data set (say GDP, oil prices or stock prices) have increased or decreased over the period of time. A trend line could simply be drawn by eye through a set of data points, but more properly their position and slope is calculated using statistical techniques like linear regression. Trend lines typically are straight lines, although some variations use higher degree polynomials depending on the degree of curvature desired in the line. Trend lines are sometimes used in business analytics to show changes in data over time. This has the advantage of being simple. Trend lines are often used to argue that a particular action or event (such as training, or an advertising campaign) caused observed changes at a point in time. This is a simple technique, and does not require a control group, experimental design,\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Regression toward the mean\nContent: the linear regression model.

Horizontal bar over a variable means the sample average of that variable. For example: \\overline{xy} = \\tfrac{1}{n}\\textstyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_iy_i\\ . Substituting the above expressions for \\hat\\alpha and \\hat\\beta into y = \\alpha + \\beta x, \\, yields fitted values : \\hat y = \\hat\\alpha + \\hat\\beta x, \\, which yields : \\frac{ \\hat y-\\bar{y}}{s_y} = r_{xy} \\frac{ x-\\bar{x}}{s_x} This shows the role rxy plays in the regression line of standardized data points. If −1 < rxy < 1, then we say that the data points exhibit regression toward the mean. In other words, if linear regression is the appropriate model for a set of data points whose sample correlation coefficient is not perfect, then there is regression toward the mean.\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Ordinary least squares\nContent: includes a scalar response y_i and a column vector \\mathbf{x}_i of p parameters (regressors), i.e., \\mathbf{x}_i=\\left[x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\dots, x_{ip}\\right]^\\mathsf{T}.

Let us first define the linear regression model as : y=X\\beta+\\varepsilon. It is assumed that the matrix X is standardized with Z-scores and that the column vector y is centered to have a mean of zero. Let the column vector \\beta_0 refer to the hypothesized regression parameters and let the column vector b denote the estimated parameters. We can then define : R^2=1-\\frac{(y-Xb)'(y-Xb)}{(y-X\\beta_0)'(y-X\\beta_0)}. An R^2 of 75% means that the in-sample accuracy improves by 75% if the data-optimized b solutions are used instead of the hypothesized \\beta_0 values. In the special case that \\beta_0 is a vector of zeros, we obtain the traditional R^2 again. The individual effect on R^2 of deviating from a hypothesis can be computed with R^\\otimes ('R-outer'). This p times p matrix is given by : R^{\\otimes}=(X'\\tilde y_0)(X'\\tilde y_0)' (X'X)^{-1}(\\tilde y_0'\\tilde y_0)^{-1}, where \\tilde y_0=y-X\\beta_0. The diagonal elements of R^\\otimes exactly add up to R^2. If regressors are uncorrelated and \\beta_0 is a vector of zeros, then the j^\\text{th} diagonal element of R^{\\otimes} simply corresponds to the r^2 value between x_j and y. When regressors x_i and x_j are correlated, R^\\otimes_{ii} might increase at the cost of a decrease in R^{\\otimes}_{jj}. As a result, the diagonal elements of R^{\\otimes} may be smaller than 0 and, in more exceptional cases, larger than 1.

Developing social support is vital in individual intervention, being with others to help you cope has proven to be a very effective way to avoid stress. Avoiding the stressors altogether is the best possible way to get rid of stress but that is very difficult to do in the workplace. Changing behavioral patterns, may in turn, help reduce some of the stress that is put on at work as well. Employee assistance programs can include in-house counseling programs on managing stress. Evaluative research has been conducted on EAPs that teach individuals stress control and inoculation techniques such as relaxation, biofeedback, and cognitive restructuring. Studies show that these programs can reduce the level of physiological arousal associated with high stress. Participants who master behavioral and cognitive stress-relief techniques report less tension, fewer sleep disturbances, and an improved ability to cope with workplace stressors. Another way of reducing stress at work is by simply changing the workload for an employee, or even giving them more control as to when or where they work. Some may be too overwhelmed that they have so much work to get done, or some also may have such little work that they are not sure what to do with themselves at work. Improving communications between employees also sounds like a simple approach, but it is very effective for helping reduce stress. Sometimes making the employee feel like they are a bigger part of the company, such as giving them a voice in bigger situations shows that you trust them and value their opinion. Having all the employees mesh well together is a very underlying factor which can take away much of workplace stress.

In order to combat this stress, there have been a variety of methods developed that have been proven to reduce stress and its consequences in everyday life. The majority of techniques can be classified into either physical, mental or therapeutic techniques. === Physical === Breathing techniques are one of the easiest ways to reduce stress. They require little effort and can be done anywhere at any time. Proper breathing techniques that incorporate deep abdominal breathing have been shown to reduce the physical symptoms of depression, anxiety and hypertension as well as everyday emotional symptoms of anger and nervousness. A study found cyclic sighing to be effective in reducing anxiety, negative mood and stress, and more so than equivalent-duration mindfulness meditation. These 5-min breathwork exercises consist of deep breaths followed by extended, relatively longer exhales. * News article about the study: Progressive muscle relaxation is a technique wherein people focus on flexing and holding a certain set of muscles and then slowly relaxing them and focusing attention on a group of muscles. Gradually, from top to bottom, one might feel a deep sense of relaxation. Progressive muscle relaxation is a somewhat adapted version of the Jacobsonian Relaxation Technique developed in the 1920s. Progressive muscle relaxation is currently used in clinical and non-clinical settings to reduce the effects of anxiety and sleeplessness brought upon by stress. === Mental === Meditation has long been practiced around the world, but has only become commonplace relatively recently in North America.

In addition to these potential sources of stress, college students are also faced with often rigorous academic demands. In order to manage this stress, students rely on many strategies including problem-focused and emotion-focused coping. Problem-focused strategies employ action-oriented behavioral activities like planning, for example. Emotion-focused strategies involve the expression of emotion and often include the altering of expectations. Although problem-focused strategies have often been found to be more effective than emotion-focused strategies, both categories include coping mechanisms that effectively reduce the negative impacts of stress. There are several practical examples of problem-focused or approach-based coping strategies. Notably, developing time management skills, avoiding procrastination, and goal-setting are associated with stress reduction. These skills allow students to better prioritize new responsibilities, leaving them more time for sleep and leisure activities, which have been shown to reduce stress. Additionally, working towards or maintaining healthy sleep habits helps individuals better cope with high levels of stress.Managing Stress. (2018). Retrieved from https://campusmindworks.org/help-yourself/self-care/managing-stress/ Several emotion-focused strategies have also been found to be effective in combating stress. Accommodation strategies that do not directly change the stressor, but rather change one's emotions surrounding the stressors, such as positive re framing, are widely associated with stress reduction.Carver, C.

This is a preferred strategy and is useful in many environments, but in some cases it is not possible or reasonably practicable to control the environment, and some stressors are inherently beyond control. *Training to improve the ability to cope in stressful situations. This is the goal of stress exposure training. It is the second line of defense. *Provision of care and support to those experiencing symptoms resulting from exposure to stress. This necessarily applies only to survivors and is an indication that the preferred options have failed. ==Training objectives== *Understanding of the stress environment: A lower level of stress will generally be experienced when a greater level of advance information on a stressful situation is made available. The subject is enabled to form more accurate expectations about the situation, increasing predictability and lowering surprise. The level of distraction is thereby reduced, and some planning is possible, which increases the avoidance of performance errors. *Skill development under benign conditions: There are a wide range of stress effects that can degrade task performance. Stress training may provide practice in behavioural and cognitive skills which allow better performance under stress, such as multi-tasking skills and prioritising critical activities. *Building confidence in the ability to perform under stress: The training is effective when a sense of mastery is achieved. Negative experiences will not have the desired effect. ==Application of the techniques== *Providing information: Information on stress and its likely effects is provided, and the value and goals of the training are explained, so that the learner can understand the purpose and develop a positive attitude towards the expected benefits.

Here are a few things people have tried to decrease anxiety throughout their everyday life: * Be physically active. Having a routine to follow can help stay active throughout the week. Staying active throughout the week can be a great way to relieve stress and improve mood. This exercise doesn't need to be strenuous. It can start out easy and slowly increase in intensity. It's best to get at least two and a half hours of moderate exercise in each week or one hour and 15 mins of intense activity each week. Moderate exercise could include anything that is not high intensity like brisk walking. Intense exercise could include things like swimming laps or jogging. It can also be a combination of both, but that isn't needed if trying to manage anxiety. * Get enough sleep. This means waking up and feeling rested. Sometimes people will experience problems with sleeping, if this is the case, consult your doctor. * Do things that help you relax. There are many techniques that can help reach relaxation. Things like meditation or yoga are just some of the techniques used. * Eating healthy. This has some evidence to reduced anxiety. Eating healthy involves focusing on the main food groups like fruits and vegetables as well as protein and whole grains. * Avoid drugs and alcohol. Consuming these can cause adverse reactions that affect anxiety. * Avoid smoking or caffeine. Caffeine is found in things like coffee and soda.

Using social media, Jamil often criticises media industry standards and labels other female celebrities \"double agents of the patriarchy\" by promoting unhealthy body image, often invoking her own experience of having an eating disorder in her arguments. In 2013, she criticised Rihanna in her column for Company magazine, blaming her for maintaining a relationship with her abuser for fame, smoking marijuana, and posting \"provocative images on Instagram to millions of hungry followers\".

The LGBT grooming conspiracy theory- claiming that LGBTQ people and allies are systematically grooming children- has been promoted online by both users and mainstream politicians such as Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert. One study on Twitter found that use of the term \"groomer\" in tweets spiked on multiple occasions, including the passing of the Florida Parental Rights in Education Act, the signing into law of said act, and Twitter posting a statement that tweets calling transgender or nonbinary people \"groomers\" violates its hate speech policy. Despite Twitter's prior public stance against transphobia and homophobia on its platform, the company was criticized by organizations such as the Human Rights Campaign for still being inefficient. One audit by the organization found that Twitter failed to act on 99 out of 100 of the most viewed anti-LGBT tweets between January and July 2022. Regardless, the acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk has led to vastly loosened hate speech restrictions, especially in terms of anti-LGBTQ content. Following Musk's takeover, retweets and mentions of right-wing figures' anti-LGBT tweets increased by over 1200%. Similarly, a 2020 study on Facebook by Media Matters for America found that right-leaning sources took up a vast majority of interactions in transgender topics compared to left-leaning or queer sources, with anti-LGBT outlets such as The Daily Wire and LifeSiteNews earning the highest engagements out of any source analyzed in the study.

Following the tweet, Voiceverse admitted to plagiarizing voices from 15.ai as their own platform, claiming that their marketing team had used the project without giving proper credit and that the \"Chubbiverse team [had] no knowledge of this.\" In response to the admission, 15 tweeted \"Go fuck yourself.\" The final tweet went viral, accruing over 75,000 total likes and 13,000 total retweets across multiple reposts.

Transitive verbs Intransitive verbs Imperfective (ya) TV (ya) x-IV Perfective la TV Ø-IV ====Perfect==== Not to be confused with the perfective aspect, the perfect aspect generally signals the resultant state of an action or event, similar to participles in English. The perfect aspect is always marked with a suffix, which changes between transitive, intransitive, and passive constructions. For transitive verbs, the allomorph -oj follows monosyllabic verb stems, while -ej follows polysyllabic verb stems, though the generalization of -oj and subsequent disappearance of -ej seem to be changes in progress. Observe the following two sentences and their translations, the first with the verb ichʼ (\"take\") and the second with the verb tsʼibuy (\"write\"): * K-ichʼ-oj (\"I have it (with me)\") * J-tsʼibuy-ej (\"I wrote it/It's written\") Perfect intransitive verbs take the suffix -em, which has an allomorph -en following a labial consonant (in Tzeltal, /p, b, w/) * Atin-em (\"He washed himself/He is clean\": atin \"to wash oneself\") * Lub-en (\"He tired himself/He is tired\": lub \"to be tired\") While verbs in the passive voice are typically conjugated as intransitive (passive transitive verbs taking the suffix -ot), passives in the perfect aspect do not take the intransitive suffix -em but instead receive a unique suffix, -bil. Thus to translate \"He is seen\" (il: \"see\") one would say Il-bil and not Il-ot-em. Perfect constructions in Tzeltal can also signal a \"persistent state,\" similar to the function described above but without the necessity that the characterization be the result of an action or event.\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Dutch grammar\nContent: passive form Verbs can belong to several classes at once, depending on use. Specifically, many transitive verbs can also be used intransitively, and are thus ambitransitive. For example, \"I eat an apple\" contains a transitive verb, while \"I eat\" contains an unergative intransitive verb. Most ditransitive verbs can also be used as monotransitives (with only one object, direct or indirect) or even intransitives. Whether an intransitive use is unergative or unaccusative depends both on the verb and on the meaning in which it is used. Generally, most transitive verbs become unergatives when the object is removed; these are accusative verbs. But there is also a sizable number of so-called ergative verbs, which become unaccusative when there is no object. Consequently, these verbs switch from active to either passive or middle meaning when the object is dropped. Examples exist in both Dutch and English, such as the transitive \"I break the glass\" versus unaccusative \"the glass breaks\". In both cases, the glass is the patient, but in the first case it's the direct object while in the second it's the subject. The auxiliary of such verbs is used for both passive and intransitive use, making those uses essentially indistinguishable. The phrase can be interpreted as both \"the glass has been broken\" and \"the glass is broken\". Alongside the normal conjugated verb forms, Dutch has a variety of verbal meanings that are expressed using auxiliary verbs or other additional words. The use of auxiliary verbs, particularly of the perfect tenses and the passive voice -if extant-, depends on the transitivity class of the verb. ====Perfect, future and passive==== The perfect indicates that an action is complete.

It works by applying the suffix “-ka” to adjective and uninflectible verb stems, creating transitive verb stems. Moving from Example 4A to 4B, “-ka” is added to an adjective stem “perop” (beans). When the object and/or subject is unspecified or implicitly known in a sentence, uninflectible verbs are normally employed. The second transitivizer suffix, “-kwa”, is similar to “-ka”, in that it creates transitive verb stems from adjective and uninflectible verb stems (Galucio, 2001, 101). However, it may also create transitive verb stems from nouns. Moving from Example 4C to 4D, the noun “pan” described by the adjective “black” is augmented by the addition of “-kwa”. This allows for both the implicitly stated subject “he/she” and the object “me” to be introduced. Valency decrease in Mekéns is achieved by use of the intransitivizer, and is formed by applying the intransitivizer prefix “e-“ to transitive verb forms, thus creating intransitive verb stems. The addition of this prefix to the transitive verb also creates morphological causativization. In Example 5A, the noun “banana” is described by the adjective “ripe”. In 5B, the instransitivizer “e-“ is subsequently applied, introducing causation to the sentence, in an intransitive construction. There is only one argument in the sentence, (bananas), which is the causee, since it is receiving the action of the verb “ripe”. ==Plurals== The plural in Mekéns is achieved by attaching a morpheme to nouns, pronouns, verbs and auxiliaries. The morpheme and collective clitic\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Object (grammar)\nContent: time in English, e.g. ::Fred gave me a book. ::a. A book was given (to) me.—Passive sentence identifies a book as an object in the starting sentence. ::b. I was given a book.—Passive sentence identifies me as an object in the starting sentence. The second criterion is also a reliable criterion for analytic languages such as English, since the relatively strict word order of English usually positions the object after the verb(s) in declarative sentences. In the majority of languages with fixed word order, the subject precedes the object. However, the opposite is true for the very small proportion (approximately 2.9%) of the world's languages that utilize object–subject word order by default. ==Verb classes== Verbs can be classified according to the number and/or type of objects that they do or do not take. The following table provides an overview of some of the various verb classes:For a classification of transitive verbs along the lines used here but using different terminology, see for instance Conner (1968:103ff.). ::::: Transitive verbs Number of objects Examples Monotransitive One object I fed the dog. Ditransitive Two objects You lent me a lawnmower. Tritransitive Three objects I'll trade you this bicycle for your binoculars. quoting Intransitive verbs Semantic role of subject Examples Unaccusative Patient The man stumbled twice, The roof collapsed. Unergative Agent He works in the morning, They lie often. ErgativeConcerning ergative verbs, see for instance the Collins Cobuild English Grammar (1995:155f.) and Biber et al. (1999:155f.). and object-deletion verbsThe term object-deletion verb is adopted from Biber et al. (1999:147). Such verbs are also called ambitransitive. can be transitive or intransitive, as indicated in the following table: :::::::::: Transitive Example Ergative\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Ergative–absolutive alignment\nContent: for TEA has the motion for the verb DRINK with a manual alphabet handshape च /ca/ (standing for the first letter of the Nepali word TEA चिया /chiya:/) being incorporated as the object.) ==Approximations of ergativity in English== English has derivational morphology that parallels ergativity in that it operates on intransitive verbs and objects of transitive verbs. With certain intransitive verbs, adding the suffix \"-ee\" to the verb produces a label for the person performing the action: :\"John has retired\" → \"John is a retiree\" :\"John has escaped\" → \"John is an escapee\" However, with a transitive verb, adding \"-ee\" does not produce a label for the person doing the action. Instead, it gives us a label for the person to whom the action is done: :\"Susie employs Mike\" → \"Mike is an employee\" :\"Mike has appointed Susie\" → \"Susie is an appointee\" Etymologically, the sense in which \"-ee\" denotes the object of a transitive verb is the original one, arising from French past participles in \"-é\". This is still the prevalent sense in British English: the intransitive uses are all 19th-century American coinages and all except \"escapee\" are still marked as \"chiefly U.S.\" by the Oxford English Dictionary. English also has a number of so-called ergative verbs, where the object of the verb when transitive is equivalent to the subject of the verb when intransitive. When English nominalizes a clause, the underlying subject of an intransitive verb and the underlying object of a transitive verb are both marked with the possessive case or with the preposition \"of\" (the choice depends on the type and length of the noun: pronouns and short nouns are typically marked with the possessive, while long and complex NPs\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Ambitransitive verb\nContent: is covered by pseudo-reflexive verbs. These verbs behave like ambitransitives, but the intransitive form requires a clitic pronoun that usually serves also for reflexive constructions. See for example, in Spanish (which uses the pronoun se in the third person): *La ventana se rompió. \"The window broke.\" *Este barco se está hundiendo. \"This boat is sinking.\" *Se derritió todo el helado. \"All of the ice cream melted.\" In the example, the verbs romper, hundir and derretir are all transitive; they become intransitive by using the pseudo-reflexive clitic, and the direct object becomes the intransitive subject. Ambiguity may arise between these and true reflexive forms, especially when the intransitive subject is animate (and therefore a possible agent). Me estoy hundiendo usually means \"I'm sinking\" (patientive first person), but it could also mean \"I'm sinking myself\", \"I'm getting myself sunk\" (agentive). ==See also== * Diathesis alternation * Valency (linguistics) * Transitivity (grammar) ==References== ==External links== *Changing valency: Case studies in transitivity (edited by R. M. W. Dixon & A. Y. Aikhenvald, Research Centre for Linguistic Typology, La Trobe University, Melbourne) Category:Transitivity and valency fr:Transitivité (grammaire)#Verbes labiles\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Kabardian grammar\nContent: and transitive without (almost) any morphological change). Most of these are agentive, with only some being patientive. For example: *тракторыр мавэ: \"the tractor plows\" *тракторым щӀыр евэ: \"the tractor plows the land\" *абджыр мэкъутэ \"The glass is broken\", *щӏалэм абджыр екъутэ \"The boy is breaking the glass\". Through valency increasing operations, both intransitive and transitive verbs can get one or more indirect objects. One frequent way is to use preverbs, for example the generic preverb е- \"to/at\". Thus intransitive verbs can also govern over 2 arguments only that the cases are switched (since the subject is in the absolutive and the indirect object in the ergative (oblique). For example: *Щӏалэр пщащэм еплъащ \"The boy will look at the girl\", *щIалэм мыIэрысэр пщащэм иритащ \"the boy gave the apple to the girl\" *Лӏыр жыгым щӏэлъ \"The man lays under the tree\". *Щӏалэр тхылъым йоджэ \"The boy reads the book\". Intransitive verbs can be turned into transitive with the causative affix -гъэ- (meaning \"to force, to make\"). For example: *Ар мажэ \"He is running\", but Абы ар е-гъа-жэ \"He forces him to run\", *Ар матхэ \"He is writing\", but Абы ар е-гъа-тхэ \"He makes him to write\". The verbs in the first sentences мажэ \"is running\", матхэ \"is writing\" are intransitive, and the verbs in the second sentences егъажэ \"forces ... to run\", егъатхэ \"makes ... to write\" are already transitive. ===Person Markers=== The differentiation of person markers depends upon the parameters of person, number, and case. Interestingly, the first\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Tzeltal language\nContent: tik/ \"theme formative,\" \"intransitive,\" \"plural\" ===Verbs=== Conjugated verbs include at least a transitive or intransitive theme (formed from either an unaffixed root or a root with derivational affixes), one person marker (if transitive) or two (if intransitive), and an aspectual mark (which can be a zero-mark in the case of intransitive verbs with imperfective aspect). Verbs are also the only part of speech to take aspectual markers. In almost every case, these markers differ between transitive and intransitive verbs, a difference further systematized by the ergative-absolutive case system. Among the affixes shared by both transitive and intransitive verbs are -el (derives a verbal noun, similar to an infinitive marker), and the lexical aspect suffixes -(V)lay (iterative aspect marker), and -tilay (expresses plurality of action). For example, the verb tam (\"collect\") may be affixed to tam-tilay-el (\"to collect multiple scattered objects\"), and the verb way (\"sleep\") can be affixed to way-ulay-el (\"to sleep without waking\"). Transitive verbs marked with -el are interpreted as having passive voice. To create a transitive, active infinitive, the -el suffix is used along with a third-person ergative prefix which must agree with the subject of the verb. Thus, the transitive verb le (\"look for\") could be affixed as le-el (\"to be looked for\") and as s-le-el (\"to look (for something)/looking for something\"). Alternatively, a transitive infinitive can be expressed with the suffix -bel to the verbal theme; notably, these forms are fully inflected for ergative and absolutive cases. Thus the morphemes in j-le-bel-at (\"for me to look for you\") correspond to (first- person ergative marker)-\"look for\"-(infinitive marker)-(second person absolutive marker).

Although investment in mobile marketing strategies like advergaming is slightly more expensive than what is intended for a mobile app, a good strategy can make the brand derive a substantial revenue. Games that use advergaming make the users remember better the brand involved. This memorization increases virality of the content so that the users tend to recommend them to their friends and acquaintances, and share them via social networks.The Most Addictive Mobile Marketing Strategy - Advergaming One form of in-game mobile advertising is what allows players to actually play. As a new and effective form of advertising, it allows consumers to try out the content before they actually install it. This type of marketing can also really attract the attention of users like casual players. These advertising blur the lines between game and advertising, and provide players with a richer experience that allows them to spend their precious time interacting with advertising. This kind of advertisement is not only interesting, but also brings some benefits to marketers. As this kind of in-gaming mobile marketing can create more effective conversion rates because they are interactive and have faster conversion speeds than general advertising. Moreover, games can also offer a stronger lifetime value. They measure the quality of the consumer in advance to provide some more in-depth experience. So this type of advertising can be more effective in improving user stickiness than advertising channels such as stories and video. ===QR codes=== Two-dimensional barcodes that are scanned with a mobile phone camera.

According to author and CEO of TopRank Online Marketing, Lee Odden, a Social Media Strategy is also necessary to ensure optimization. This is a similar concept to Bhargava's list of rules for SMO. The Social Media Strategy may consider: # Objectives e.g. creating brand awareness and using social media for external communications. # Listening e.g. monitoring conversations relating to customers and business objectives. # Audience e.g. finding out who the customers are, what they do, who they are influenced by, and what they frequently talk about. It is important to work out what customers want in exchange for their online engagement and attention. # Participation and content e.g. establishing a presence and community online and engaging with users by sharing useful and interesting information. # Measurement e.g. keeping a record of likes and comments on posts, and the number of sales to monitor growth and determine which tactics are most useful in optimizing social media. According to Lon Safko and David K. Brake in The Social Media Bible, it is also important to act like a publisher by maintaining an effective organizational strategy, to have an original concept and unique \"edge\" that differentiates one's approach from competitors, and to experiment with new ideas if things do not work the first time. If a business is blog-based, an effective method of SMO is using widgets that allow users to share content to their personal social media platforms.

The products launched in 2015. ==History== Launched in January 2015 by Alec Oxenford, former CEO of OLX, the app initially targeted the U.S. market, competing against eBay and Craigslist, the online marketplace leaders since the 1990s. In May 2016, the company merged with Wallapop, another mobile classifieds startup. Letgo remained the majority owner of the company and the brand remained Letgo. At the time, there were about 10 million monthly active users between the two apps, according to SurveyMonkey data published by TechCrunch. From its launch, the company did not charge for its services, earning no revenue, as part of its strategy to grow quickly. As of June 2018, the listing service remained free, but the app added a paid beta feature allowing users to place their sales item above organic search results. Three quarters of the first round investment of $100 million was slated for marketing. The ad agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky Miami created a television ad campaign for the app, directed by filmmaker Craig Gillespie. Each advertisement is premised on an extreme situation, such as a person dangling over a cliff who might plunge down because he's holding on to a bowling ball, where the sensible thing to do is to let go of the item. CP+B Miami also created a series of four ads allowing customers to incorporate images and descriptions of their items for sale directly into a satirical video ad, such as one featuring action film star Dolph Lundgren as a mercenary.

Application 20040259599) teaches a similar invention for presenting advertising to unspecified persons near a mobile phone user, using the rear screen, while the user speaks on a mobile phone. Presentation to persons other than the user will likely be used to increase market share in low-income/high-population areas, as well as provide a line extension for ad-supported MVNO's. A new approach to mobile content advertising is the use of viral marketing. Through specially designed programmes users can send recommendations for mobile content they like to their contact lists.

This stock-market course pulled Smith away from macroeconomics towards finance, and the use and misuse of statistics in finance pulled Smith towards a lifelong interest in the abuse of data and statistical analysis. Tobin once wryly observed that the bad old days when researchers had to do calculations by hand were actually a blessing. In today's language, it was a feature, not a flaw. The calculations were so hard that people thought hard before they calculated. Today, with terabytes of data and lightning-fast computers, it is too easy to calculate first, think later. Smith argues that it is better to think hard before calculating. == Notable contributions == === The Housing Market === Smith has been a lifelong proponent of value investing, buying stocks based on the cash they generate, instead of trying to predict short-term movements in stock prices.Smith, Gary. (2017). Money Machine: The Surprisingly Simple Power of Value Investing, New York: AMACOM. The same principles apply to real estate. From a financial standpoint, the decision to buy a house should be based on the cash flow—the rental savings minus the mortgage payments, property taxes, and other expenses associated with home ownership—not guesses about future home prices.Smith, Margaret H.; Smith, Gary.

If you choose to rent a house, there is no need to worry about maintenance and no real estate taxes. Then your life will have more flexibility since you can move to wherever you want. But you should care about the rent fee including electricity, water, internet, and parking. If you have a pet, you will also have a pet fee. #: Mortgages: When purchasing a home/real estate, it is important to understand your options. Most people either go with a 15 or 30-year plan. The rate of payment can be a fixed plan, in which it is a constant payment of the same amount over a certain period of time. The other is an ARM mortgage (Adjustable-Rate Mortgage). This rate can be adjusted and agreed upon to be changed in the given plan. Mortgage plans depend on the situation you are in, and it is important to assess your credit score, along with your financial status, when contemplating plans. #: Location / Wants and Needs: When choosing a new home, it is important to take into consideration where you would like to reside, along with qualities that you both want and need in a home. These variables can cause an increase or decrease in the price of an estate. When deciding where you want to live, some things you should consider include, but are not limited to, whether you’d prefer the city or rural area, what length of a commute you want, the importance in quality public schools, what level of safety you’d like to have, the amount of land you want, included amenities, and if you’d like to live\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Power of acceptance\nContent: of promises within a reasonable time, then the offer is enforceable, provided that there is nominal consideration. Here, nominal consideration can be as little as one dollar. ==== Unilateral offer ==== Once an offeree has begun the performance in reliance on the unilateral offer, an implied obligation may apply to the offeror that the promise cannot be revoked. In the English case Errington v Wood,Errington v Wood (1952) 1 KB 920; (1952) 1 All ER 149. a father bought a house for his son and daughter-in-law to live in. He paid one- third of the price, and said to his son and daughter-in-law that if they paid the regular mortgage instalments for the remaining two-thirds of the price until the mortgage was paid off, then he would transfer the title of the house to them. Subsequently, the father died, and the mother claimed possession of the house. It was held that the father's promise to convey the title to the son and daughter-in-law was irrevocable once they had begun paying the regular mortgage instalments. No order of possession was therefore granted. However, there are situations where the court views the implied obligation as unjustified. In the English case Luxor (Eastbourne) Ltd v Cooper,Luxor (Eastbourne) Ltd v Cooper [1941] AC 108 the plaintiff property agent introduced a prospective buyer to the defendant property owner. But the defendant then changed his mind and decided not to complete the transaction.

Mr Parmar then put the house on the market for £18,000. When Mrs Chhokar returned, she discovered the locks had been changed. She broke in but was forced out by Mr Parmar who threatened and assaulted her. Mrs Chhokar managed to gain entry to the house again and stayed put. The question for the court was whether Mrs Chhokar could be said to be in 'actual occupation' even though she was not physically present in the house at the time of the transfer (sale). ==Judgment== ===High Court=== Ewbank J ordered that Mr Parmar held the property on trust for himself and Mrs Chhokar in equal shares; that it be sold in 9 months; and until then, she must pay him a rent of £8 a week. She appealed, arguing she should stay rent-free until a sale. ===Court of Appeal=== The Court of Appeal, sitting as a panel of two judges, held the purpose of the trust was to give Mrs Chhokar and her children a home. There was no reason for an order for sale, having regard to the interest of third parties. Because Mr Parmar stepped into Mr Chhokar’s shoes, it would be inequitable for her to have to pay an occupational rent, but he should be entitled to credit for paying off the mortgage. Accordingly, she and Mr Parmar held the house as tenants in common in equity in equal shares. Cumming-Bruce LJ remarked that for the question about whether an order for sale should be made, bankruptcy case law was analogous and relevant.

Following the decision, many of the plaintiffs expressed an intent to find other means by which they could continue contesting the seizure of their homes. Soon after the decision, city officials announced plans to charge the residents of the homes for back rent for the five years since condemnation procedures began. The city contended that the residents have been on city property for those five years and owe tens of thousands of dollars of rent. In June 2006, Governor M. Jodi Rell intervened with New London city officials, proposing the homeowners involved in the suit be deeded property in the Fort Trumbull neighborhood so they may retain their homes. A group of New London residents formed a local political party, One New London, to combat the takings. The controversy was eventually settled when the city paid substantial additional compensation to the homeowners and agreed to move Kelo's home to a new location. The land was never deeded back to the original homeowners, most of whom have left New London for nearby communities. Three years after the Supreme Court case was decided, the Kelo house was dedicated after being relocated to 36 Franklin Street, a site close to downtown New London.

Mr Gibson applied, on a form of the council, for details of his house price and mortgage terms. In February 1971, the Treasurer replied: > The corporation may be prepared to sell the house to you at the purchase > price of £2,725 less 20% = £2,180 (freehold)… This letter should not be > regarded as a firm offer of a mortgage. If you would like to make formal > application to buy your Council house please complete the enclosed > application form and return it to me as soon as possible. In March 1971, Mr Gibson completed the application form with the exception of the date on which his lease was to end, and returned it to the council. The Labour Party returned to power in Manchester in the May 1971 election, and halted new sales. Mr Gibson was told that he could not complete the purchase. He then sued the council, arguing that a binding contract had already come into force. ==Judgment== ===Court of Appeal=== In the Court of Appeal, Lord Denning MR held that there was a contract, because one should \"look at the correspondence as a whole and at the conduct of the parties and see there from whether the parties have come to an agreement on everything that was material\".

According to the research,Nielsen, \"Online Shopping Trends\", (USA: The Nielsen Company, 2010) reviews on electronics (57%) such as DVD players, cellphones, or PlayStations, and so on, reviews on cars (45%), and reviews on software (37%) play an important role in influencing consumers who tend to make purchases online. Furthermore, 40% of online shoppers indicate that they would not even buy electronics without consulting online reviews first. In addition to online reviews, peer recommendations on online shopping pages or social media websites play a key role for online shoppers when they are researching future purchases. 90% of all purchases made are influenced by social media. ==Payment== Online shoppers commonly use a credit card or a PayPal account in order to make payments. However, some systems enable users to create accounts and pay by alternative means, such as: * Billing to mobile phones and landlines * Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies * Cash on delivery (C.O.D.) * Cheque/ Check * Debit card * Direct debit in some countries * Electronic money of various types * Gift cards * Invoice, especially popular in some markets/countries, such as Switzerland * Postal money order * Wire transfer/delivery on payment Some online shops will not accept international credit cards.

Each country has consumers of the same demographic, but due to the cultural influence of the geographical area, their purchase decisions are different. A basic example of a consumer profile is: males aged 35–40 who live in the US and have a university-level education (demographic), are a sociable extrovert from a top-middle economic class and live an active lifestyle (psychographic), lives in Nashville, Tennessee (geographic) and makes small and frequent purchases without considering the product's brand (behavioural). This profile will allow the business to tailor their marketing campaign to attract specific consumers. There are many methods of demographic, psychographic, geographic and behavioral data collection. There are quantitative methods, being statistical processes such as surveys and questionnaires, and qualitative methods, being in-depth approaches such as focus groups or comprehensive interviews (Dudley et al. 2014). The different aspects of consumers are all essential to a business when it is planning a marketing campaign, as the information that the business gathers will determine what the most profitable target market for the campaign is, and how to reach this market. The business must also look to their competitors to see what processes they are currently taking to try and solve the problem, and which consumers they are targeting (Sherlock, 2014). This will allow the business to get an idea of the type of consumer they will be targeting, and what the best way is to communicate with this type of consumer. This information can be used to allow the business to differentiate slightly from the competition in order to give them a competitive advantage once the marketing campaign begins. Once the target audience has been identified, the business must then create content for the campaign that will resonate and effectively communicate\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Generation Z in the United States\nContent: if they disliked the customer service. 81% said they preferred brick-and-mortar stores and 73% said they would like to discover new products in such a store. 67% said they preferred products whose ingredients they can understand and 65% preferred simple packaging. 58% told the pollsters manually browsing products helps them disconnect from the digital world, a sort of \"retail therapy.\" 22% said social media is a source of stress for them, a number that is higher than that for the Millennials (18%), Generation X (13%), and the Baby Boomers (8%). In addition, while more than half said they sought environmentally friendly products, only 38% were willing to pay extra for them. Young American consumers of this cohort are less likely to pay a premium for what they want compared to their counterparts from emerging economies. While majorities might signal their support for certain ideals such as \"environmental consciousness\" to pollsters, actual purchases do not reflect their stated views, as can be seen from their high demand for cheap but not durable clothing (\"fast fashion\"), or preference for rapid delivery. Nor are they willing to shun firms whose owners have \"conservative\" values, such as Chick-fil-A, which remains one of the most popular fast-food restaurant chains in the United States among teenagers. Milk consumption has declined among young people and the growing rate of lactose intolerance among the ethnically diverse Generation Z is part of the reason why. Nostalgia is a major theme of the behavior of consumers from Generation Z. For example, 2000s vintage electronics and fashion are back in vogue by the early 2020s. ==== Financial security ==== thumb|The number Generation Z consumers with credit-card balances increased significantly in 2019.|alt=|left According to the USA Today, 69% of Generation\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Vape shop\nContent: had an increase in the number of vape shops. In December 2015, there were 2,400 vape shops in France, 400 fewer than in March of the same year.

Effective August 8, 2016, under the Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) rules, a vape shop that mixes or prepares e-liquids, or makes or modifies any kind of e-cigarettes, is regulated as a tobacco product manufacturer. The categorization of vape shops that make or modify e-cigarettes including e-liquids as manufacturers mandating abiding with the US FDA manufacturing standards, have been extended to August 8, 2022. Vape shops cannot hand out free samples to patrons or sell to individuals under 18 years of age. Individuals under the age of 18 are not allowed to handle e-cigarette devices. Retailers are required to ask for photo ID from patrons who look to be under 27 years of age. \"One of the most important provisions to help reduce youth access to tobacco products is the prohibition on free samples of tobacco products,\" US FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb stated in October 2017. \"With more youth using e-cigarettes than any other tobacco product, it’s critical that manufacturers and retailers understand how we intend to enforce this provision,\" he added. Five individuals were arrested for selling e-cigarette products to patrons under 21 years of age at vape shops in Suffolk County, New York in December 2017, local police stated.

Furthermore, some supermarkets have trialled a policy of asking all alcohol purchasers for ID irrespective of apparent age, which has led to senior citizens as old as 86 being refused service. In many of the large supermarket chains, including Marks & Spencer, The Co-operative and Waitrose, a shop assistant found selling alcohol to an underage person is liable to severe punishment by their employer, including possible dismissal, in addition to the standard legal penalties. In any of these companies, the 'Think 25' policy is drilled into all employees very stringently. Many independent off-licences continue to apply Challenge 21; enforcement is less stringent in many of these establishments. Other off- licences such as the food halls of Selfridges and Harvey Nichols, Spirited Wines, and the long established shops around Soho are not currently members of the RASG. Some Tesco stores have experimented with a Challenge 30 policy (i.e. requesting the I.D. of anyone who could be 11 or less years over the legal drinking age) dismissing the criticism that it could have an adverse effect on sales. Likewise, some supermarkets in the United States, such as Publix and Winn-Dixie, operate a \"Challenge 40\" policy, requesting the I.D. of anyone who looks 21 years or less over the legal drinking age. However, selling alcohol to minors is treated much more severely in the US than in the UK. In recent years pubs and supermarkets have come under increasing pressure from the government to prevent the sale of alcohol to under 18s.http://press.homeoffice.gov.uk/press-releases/alcohol-industry-underage- sales.html Currently the law comes down much heavier on those selling the alcohol than those illegally buying it.

With more people staying at home, both by choice as well as through government lockdowns, there was a decline in brick-and-mortar shopping. On the other hand, e-commerce surged 34% during 2020, and in 2021 surpassed levels not expected until 2025, projected to reach $843 billion in the US in 2021. Despite persistent cross-country differences, the Covid crisis has enhanced dynamism within the e-commerce landscape across countries and has dilated the scope of e-commerce, as well as through new firms, client segments (e.g. elderly) and product (e.g. groceries). The pandemic has created a shift in the manner shoppers behave and perform their activities, directly moving the e-commerce industry so the prosperity of e-commerce during pandemic lockdown has increased significantly. The impact of the epidemic on transportation and production has affected e-commerce. Customers will consider whether goods can be shipped on time and delivered on time, and these factors will affect their choices. Under the current epidemic conditions, some online sellers, taking advantage of the characteristics of e-commerce, are defrauding consumers. The problems and flaws exposed by these e-merchants in the epidemic situation further push e-merchants towards a more mature and regulated path. Social media plays a huge role, Facebook and own e-commerce web sites of e-commerce firms are the foremost growing sales channels since the start of the COVID-19 crisis. Global e-commerce sales are expected to reach $6.5 trillion by 2023, up from $3.5 trillion in 2019. == Restaurant sector == The pandemic has impacted the restaurant business.

There are five essential categories of E-commerce: * Business to Business * Business to Consumer * Business to Government * Consumer to Business * Consumer to Consumer == Forms == Contemporary electronic commerce can be classified into two categories. The first category is business based on types of goods sold (involves everything from ordering \"digital\" content for immediate online consumption, to ordering conventional goods and services, to \"meta\" services to facilitate other types of electronic commerce). The second category is based on the nature of the participant (B2B, B2C, C2B and C2C). On the institutional level, big corporations and financial institutions use the internet to exchange financial data to facilitate domestic and international business.

Originally intended as a way for phone companies to brand phones attached to their networks, the operator logo has since become a method by which owners may customise their phones to reflect their own interests. It helped kick off mobile phone content advertising which became particularly prominent with ring tone adverts. ==History== The older mobile phones of 90's (Black & white LCD Screen) had options to show telecom operator logo instead of the showing the name in plain text. Later various companies provided custom logo and designs to set as Operator logo. These logos can be shared by SMS with other people. Later on when color mobiles came to market, Colorful logo option came to mobile devices. An industry has sprung up around the use of these Custom logo designs, and around ring tones, tailored towards phones, such as those made by Nokia, which can receive new logos in a text message.

Designers may prefer flat design because it allows interface designs to be more streamlined and efficient. It is easier to quickly convey information while still looking visually appealing and approachable. Additionally, it makes it easier to design an interface that is responsive to changes in browser size across different devices. With minimal design elements, websites are able to load faster and resize easily, and still look sharp on high-definition screens. As a design approach, it is often contrasted to skeuomorphism and rich design. ==History== Flat design is primarily influenced by the International Typographic Style (also known as Swiss Style), text user interfaces, modernism, and the styles emerging from Bauhaus. The International Typographic style is often considered the most substantial influence on flat design, and its emergence and popularization during the 1950s and 1960s is regarded as the starting point of flat design, although it would not make an appearance in the digital world for some time thereafter. In 2002, Microsoft released Windows Media Center, and in 2006, the Zune MP3 player, both of which contained elements of flat design. The design of the Zune was clean and simple, with a focus on large lower case typography, silhouette-style logos, and monochromatic font colors.

Constraints in mobile UI design in constraints include the limited attention span of the user and form factors, such as a mobile device's screen size for a user's hand(s). Mobile UI context includes signal cues from user activity, such as the location where or the time when the device is in use, that can be observed from user interactions within a mobile app. Such context clues can be used to provide automatic suggestions when scheduling an appointment or activity or to filter a list of various services for the user. The user is often the focus of interaction with their device, and the interface entails components of both hardware and software. User input allows for the users to manipulate a system, and device's output allows the system to indicate the effects of the users' manipulation. Overall, mobile UI design's goal is mainly for an understandable, user-friendly interface. Functionality is supported by mobile enterprise application platforms or integrated development environments (IDEs). Developers of mobile applications must also consider a large array of devices with different screen sizes, hardware specifications, and configurations because of intense competition in mobile hardware and changes within each of the platforms. Today, mobile apps are usually distributed via an official online outlet or marketplace (e.g. Apple - The App Store, Google - Google Play) and there is a formalized process by which developers submit their apps for approval and inclusion in those marketplaces. Historically, however, that was not always the case. Mobile UIs, or front-ends, rely on mobile back-ends to support access to enterprise systems. The mobile back-end facilitates data routing, security, authentication, authorization, working off-line, and service orchestration. This functionality is supported by a\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Mobile procurement\nContent: long run. ==Native Apps vs. HTML5== Mobile interaction now exceeds desktop Web interaction by 9%. Now that mobile is the dominant form of online activity, mobile procurement is simply a natural step into today’s digital landscape. Mobile procurement platforms can be approached in two ways: native apps or Web apps using HTML5. Native Apps A native app is a mobile application developed specifically for use on mobile devices, launched directly from the home screen. In the United States, use of mobile apps greatly exceeds use of mobile Web browsing, but that trend is not worldwide. Using a native app requires development for all operating systems and brands. A fully operational native app needs to be designed for iOS, Android, Microsoft, all their various generations, and at different resolutions and orientations. For total success of an app, users will expect it to work on everything from a high-resolution tablet down to an Apple Watch. The other factor to consider with native apps is the way they access backend data. This is often more complex than a simple push to read data that takes place on a Web browser. Apps are developed, depending on their purpose and functionality, to access other applications such as the camera or local storage. Native apps can be the preferred use of mobile procurement in environments with either no IT access or highly secure networks. Financial institutions value privacy and security when considering mobile tools operating in their network. Oil and gas environments are often remote and require apps that can work with limited Internet access. A downside to mobile apps is the memory they occupy on a device. Because of this, many businesses will steer away from apps that require a great deal of storage. Web Apps and HTML5 A Web app is run\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Mobile app\nContent: devices run on battery and have less powerful processors than personal computers and also have more features such as location detection and cameras. Developers also have to consider a wide array of screen sizes, hardware specifications and configurations because of intense competition in mobile software and changes within each of the platforms (although these issues can be overcome with mobile device detection). Mobile application development requires the use of specialized integrated development environments. Mobile apps are first tested within the development environment using emulators and later subjected to field testing. Emulators provide an inexpensive way to test applications on mobile phones to which developers may not have physical access. Mobile user interface (UI) Design is also essential. Mobile UI considers constraints and contexts, screen, input and mobility as outlines for design. The user is often the focus of interaction with their device, and the interface entails components of both hardware and software. User input allows for the users to manipulate a system, and device's output allows the system to indicate the effects of the users' manipulation. Mobile UI design constraints include limited attention and form factors, such as a mobile device's screen size for a user's hand. Mobile UI contexts signal cues from user activity, such as location and scheduling that can be shown from user interactions within a mobile application. Overall, mobile UI design's goal is primarily for an understandable, user-friendly interface. Mobile UIs, or front-ends, rely on mobile back-ends to support access to enterprise systems. The mobile back-end facilitates data routing, security, authentication, authorization, working off-line, and service orchestration. This functionality is supported by a mix of middleware components including mobile app servers, Mobile Backend as a service (MBaaS), and SOA infrastructure.

The brand logo in the first design system was a stylized, geometric fox head, while the brand logo in the second design system was a simplistic, circular flame. On June 11, 2019, a new logo for the web browser was announced. The 2019 logo was more simple and stylized compared to the previous logos, and was closer in appearance to the first design system presented in 2018, though the system of logos as a whole was closer to the second system. In the 2019 redesign, the Earth was changed from blue to purple, and the design of the fox was further simplified, with its legs being removed completely. Additionally, the browser logo aimed to become more abstract in order to make the logo \"fit visually with everything else\" in the Firefox brand. The brand logo depicts a swirl of fire inspired by the circular motion of the spinning browser icon, as during the development, the team \"got a very clear signal that we didn't actually have to show a fox for people to know that it was Firefox\". Alongside the redesigned browser logo and brand logo, logos were introduced for Firefox Send, Firefox Monitor, and Firefox Lockwise. The logos for Firefox Monitor and Firefox Lockwise were unveiled in May 2019, marking the first of the redesigned Firefox logos to be announced.

(In one of the American translations, one of these camps is named Nohappimedium.) ==Lost in translation== Bell and Hockridge were widely praised for their rendition of the English language versions, maintaining the spirit and humour of the French original even when direct translation is impossible – as it often is when translating puns between languages which are not closely related. A good example occurs in Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield when Obelix redistributes the water in the spa pools by diving in, the other guests complain and the druid in charge arrives asking Vitalstatistix, \"Where are your Gauls?\" In the original French he responds Mes Gaulois sont dans la pleine (\"My Gauls are in the full one\") which is a play on a famous (in French) quote Les Gaulois sont dans la plaine (\"The Gauls are on the plain\") which sounds exactly the same, though not in English. Instead the translated reply is \"Pooling your resources\" (the water), a clever double entendre on a common phrase even though the original pun is lost. Sometimes, nothing of the original joke is salvageable. In Asterix in Britain, there is a scene in Londinium where a greengrocer argues with a buyer; in the next panel, Obelix says (in French), \"Why is that man wearing a melon?\" This relies on the fact that the French word for melon is also the name for the iconic British bowler hat; with no way to convey this in the English translation, in the British edition Obelix says, \"I say, Asterix, I think this bridge is falling\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Je ne vous oublie pas\nContent: text: \"Je ne vous oublie pas\" (in English \"I Won't Forget You\") is the lead single from Celine Dion's French-language greatest hits album, entitled On ne change pas (2005). It was released as a music download in Canada on 27 September 2005 and in France on 3 October 2005. The CD single was released in France, Belgium and Switzerland in mid-October 2005. \"Je ne vous oublie pas\" reached number two in France and was certified Gold there. ==Background and release== The lyrics, by Jacques Veneruso, who worked with Dion on her previous French album, 1 fille & 4 types, say that the song is a dedication to all Dion's fans, a declaration of love. Veneruso wrote and produced also four tracks for Dion's next French album D'elles, as well as the lead single from Sans attendre. The music video was filmed and directed by Didier Kerbrat in Montreal's Imperial Theatre in July 2005, and released in September 2005. Dion visited France in October 2005 to promote her new album and performed \"Je ne vous oublie pas\" in various TV shows. The single reached there number 2 and was certified gold (200,000 copies sold). It was also successful in other countries, reaching number 2 in Quebec, number 4 in Belgium Wallonia and number 21 in Switzerland. \"Je ne vous oublie pas\" was nominated for a 2006 Félix Award in Best Song of the Year category. The version of \"Je ne vous oublie pas\" performed by Dion and Les 500 Choristes was released in November 2006, on their album 500 Choristes avec.../vol.2.

By using query language, sharing content and data between communities and applications became much easier. APIs simplify all that by limiting outside program access to a specific set of features—often enough, requests for data of one sort or another. APIs clearly define exactly how a program will interact with the rest of the software world—saving time. An API allows software to “speak with other software.” Furthermore, an API can collect and provide information that is not publicly accessible. This is extremely enticing for researchers due to the greater number of possible avenues of research. The use of an API for data collection can be a focal point of the privacy conversation, because while the data can be anonymous, the difficulty is understanding when it becomes an invasion of privacy. Personal information can be collected in mass, but the debate over whether it breaches personal privacy is due to the inability to match this information with specific people. There have however been some concerns with API because of the recent scandal between Facebook and the political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica. What happened was “Facebook allowed a third-party developer to engineer an application for the sole purpose of gathering data. And the developer was able to exploit a loophole to gather information on not only people who used the app but all their friends — without them knowing.” ====Search engines==== Search engines are an easy way to find information without scanning every site yourself.

As a web development concept, it can be related to a web application's client side (including any web frameworks being used). A server-side web API consists of one or more publicly exposed endpoints to a defined request–response message system, typically expressed in JSON or XML by means of an HTTP-based web server. A server API (SAPI) is not considered a server-side web API, unless it is publicly accessible by a remote web application. ==Client side== A client-side web API is a programmatic interface to extend functionality within a web browser or other HTTP client. Originally these were most commonly in the form of native plug-in browser extensions however most newer ones target standardized JavaScript bindings. The Mozilla Foundation created their WebAPI specification which is designed to help replace native mobile applications with HTML5 applications.Mozilla WebAPI Wiki Google created their Native Client architecture which is designed to help replace insecure native plug-ins with secure native sandboxed extensions and applications. They have also made this portable by employing a modified LLVM AOT compiler. ==Server side== A server-side web API consists of one or more publicly exposed endpoints to a defined request–response message system, typically expressed in JSON or XML. The web API is exposed most commonly by means of an HTTP-based web server. Mashups are web applications which combine the use of multiple server-side web APIs. Webhooks are server-side web APIs that take input as a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that is designed to be used like a remote named pipe or a type of callback such that the server acts as a client to dereference the provided URI and\n\nID: 2\nTitle: API\nContent: text: An () is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software. A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an . A computer system that meets this standard is said to or an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation. In contrast to a user interface, which connects a computer to a person, an application programming interface connects computers or pieces of software to each other. It is not intended to be used directly by a person (the end user) other than a computer programmer who is incorporating it into the software. An API is often made up of different parts which act as tools or services that are available to the programmer. A program or a programmer that uses one of these parts is said to that portion of the API. The calls that make up the API are also known as subroutines, methods, requests, or endpoints. An API specification these calls, meaning that it explains how to use or implement them. One purpose of APIs is to hide the internal details of how a system works, exposing only those parts that a programmer will find useful, and keeping them consistent even if the internal details change later. An API may be custom-built for a particular pair of systems, or it may be a shared standard allowing interoperability among many systems. There are APIs for programming languages, software libraries, computer operating systems, and computer hardware. APIs originated in the 1940s, though the term did not emerge until the 1960s and 1970s. Contemporary usage of the term API often refers to\n\nID: 3\nTitle: API management\nContent: text: API management is the process of creating and publishing web application programming interfaces (APIs), enforcing their usage policies, controlling access, nurturing the subscriber community, collecting and analyzing usage statistics, and reporting on performance. API Management components provide mechanisms and tools to support developer and subscriber communities. == Components == While solutions vary, components that provide the following functions are typically found in API management products: * Gateway: a server that acts as an API front-end, receives API requests, enforces throttling and security policies, passes requests to the back-end service and then passes the response back to the requester. A gateway often includes a transformation engine to orchestrate and modify the requests and responses on the fly. A gateway can also provide functions such as collecting analytics data and providing caching. The gateway can provide the functionality to support authentication, authorization, security, audit and regulatory compliance. It can be implemented by a Reverse proxy. * Publishing tools: a collection of tools that API providers use to define APIs, for instance using the OpenAPI or RAML specifications, generate API documentation, govern API usage through access and usage policies for APIs, test and debug the execution of API, including security testing and automated generation of tests and test suites, deploy APIs into production, staging, and quality assurance environments, and coordinate the overall API lifecycle. * Developer portal/API store: community site, typically branded by an API provider, that can encapsulate for API users in a single convenient source information and functionality including documentation, tutorials, sample code, software development kits, an interactive API console and sandbox to trial APIs, the ability to subscribe to the APIs and manage subscription keys such as OAuth2 Client ID and Client Secret, and obtain support from the API\n\nID: 4\nTitle: API writer\nContent: text: An API writer is a technical writer who writes documents that describe an application programming interface (API). The primary audience includes programmers, developers, system architects, and system designers. == Overview == An API is a library consisting of interfaces, functions, classes, structures, enumerations, etc. for building a software application. It is used by developers to interact with and extend the software. An API for a given programming language or system may consist of system-defined and user-defined constructs. As the number and complexity of these constructs increases, it becomes very tedious for developers to remember all of the functions and the parameters defined. Hence, the API writers play a key role in building software applications. Due to the technical subject matter, API writers must understand application source code enough to extract the information that API documents require. API writers often use tooling that extracts software documentation placed by programmers in the source code in a structured manner, preserving the relationships between the comments and the programming constructs they document. API writers must also understand the software product and document the new features or changes as part of the new software release. The schedule of software releases varies from organization to organization. API writers need to understand the software life cycle well and integrate themselves into the systems development life cycle (SDLC). API writers in the United States generally follow The Chicago Manual of Style for grammar and punctuation. == Qualifications == API writers typically possess a mix of programming and language skills; many API writers have backgrounds in programming or technical writing. *Computer programming background (Knowledge of C, C++, Java, PHP, or other programming languages) *Knowledge of formatting standards like Doxygen, Javadoc, OpenAPI, or DITA *Knowledge of editors and tools, like FrameMaker\n\nID: 5\nTitle: API key\nContent: text: An application programming interface (API) key is a unique identifier used to authenticate and authorize a user, developer, or calling program to an API. However, they are typically used to authenticate and authorize a project with the API rather than a human user. == Usage == The API key often acts as both a unique identifier and a secret token for authentication and authorization, and will generally have a set of access rights on the API associated with it. === HTTP APIs === API keys for HTTP-based APIs can be sent in multiple ways: In the query string: POST /something?api_key=abcdef12345 HTTP/1.1 As a request header: GET /something HTTP/1.1 X-API-Key: abcdef12345 As a cookie: GET /something HTTP/1.1 Cookie: X-API-KEY=abcdef12345 == Security == API keys are generally not considered secure; they are typically accessible to clients, making it easy for someone to steal an API key. Once the key is stolen, it has no expiration, so it may be used indefinitely, unless the project owner revokes or regenerates the key. Since API keys must only be accessible to the client and server, authentication using API keys is only considered secure when used in conjunction with other security mechanisms such as HTTPS. == Incidents == In 2017, Fallible, a Delaware-based security firm examined 16,000 android apps and identified over 300 which contained hard-coded API keys for services like Dropbox, Twitter, and Slack. == References == === Book sources === * == External links == * Why and When to Use API Keys Category:Application programming interfaces\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Open API\nContent: text: An open API (often referred to as a public API) is a publicly available application programming interface that provides developers with programmatic access to a (possibly proprietary) software application or web service. Open APIs are APIs that are published on the internet and are free to access by consumers. == Alternative Definitions == There is no universally accepted definition of the term \"Open API\" and it may be used to mean a variety of things in different contexts, including: # An API for use by developers and other users with relatively few restrictions. It may require registration or enforce quotas and rate-limits, but registration is free and open to all; or # An API backed by open data. Open data is freely available for everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control; or # An API based on an open standard, which specifies the mechanism by which a consumer queries the API and interprets its responses. == Open API versus private API == === Private API === A private API is an interface that opens parts of an organization's backend data and application functionality for use by developers working within (or contractors working for) that organization. Private APIs are only exposed to internal developers therefore the API publishers have total control over what and how applications are developed. Private APIs offer substantial benefits with regards to internal collaboration. Using a private API across an organization allows for greater shared awareness of the internal data models. As the developers are working for (or contracted by) one organization, communication will be more direct and therefore they should be able to work more cohesively as a group. Private APIs can significantly diminish the development time needed to manipulate\n\nID: 7\nTitle: API\nContent: 1970s. Contemporary usage of the term API often refers to web APIs, which allow communication between computers that are joined by the internet. Recent developments in APIs have led to the rise in popularity of microservices, which are loosely coupled services accessed through public APIs. == Purpose == In building applications, an API simplifies programming by abstracting the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions the developer needs. While a graphical interface for an email client might provide a user with a button that performs all the steps for fetching and highlighting new emails, an API for file input/output might give the developer a function that copies a file from one location to another without requiring that the developer understand the file system operations occurring behind the scenes. == History of the term == The term API initially described an interface only for end-user-facing programs, known as application programs. This origin is still reflected in the name \"application programming interface.\" Today, the term is broader, including also utility software and even hardware interfaces. === 1940s and 1950s === The idea of the API is much older than the term itself. British computer scientists Maurice Wilkes and David Wheeler worked on a modular software library in the 1940s for EDSAC, an early computer. The subroutines in this library were stored on punched paper tape organized in a filing cabinet. This cabinet also contained what Wilkes and Wheeler called a \"library catalog\" of notes about each subroutine and how to incorporate it into a program. Today, such a catalog would be called an API (or an API specification or API documentation) because it instructs a programmer on how to use (or \"call\") each subroutine that the programmer needs.

A step region is formed from a finite union of adjacent rectangles resting on a common base, i.e. . If there is a unique number c such that for all such step regions S and T, then . It can be proved that such an area function actually exists. ==Units== Every unit of length has a corresponding unit of area, namely the area of a square with the given side length. Thus areas can be measured in square metres (m2), square centimetres (cm2), square millimetres (mm2), square kilometres (km2), square feet (ft2), square yards (yd2), square miles (mi2), and so forth. Algebraically, these units can be thought of as the squares of the corresponding length units. The SI unit of area is the square metre, which is considered an SI derived unit. ===Conversions=== thumb|right|alt=A diagram showing the conversion factor between different areas|Although there are 10 mm in 1 cm, there are 100 mm2 in 1 cm2. Calculation of the area of a square whose length and width are 1 metre would be: 1 metre × 1 metre = 1 m2 and so, a rectangle with different sides (say length of 3 metres and width of 2 metres) would have an area in square units that can be calculated as: 3 metres × 2 metres = 6 m2. This is equivalent\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Area\nContent: is, the area of the rectangle is the length multiplied by the width. As a special case, as in the case of a square, the area of a square with side length is given by the formula: : (square). The formula for the area of a rectangle follows directly from the basic properties of area, and is sometimes taken as a definition or axiom. On the other hand, if geometry is developed before arithmetic, this formula can be used to define multiplication of real numbers. ====Dissection, parallelograms, and triangles==== Most other simple formulas for area follow from the method of dissection. This involves cutting a shape into pieces, whose areas must sum to the area of the original shape. thumb|left|upright|A diagram showing how a parallelogram can be re-arranged into the shape of a rectangle. For an example, any parallelogram can be subdivided into a trapezoid and a right triangle, as shown in figure to the left. If the triangle is moved to the other side of the trapezoid, then the resulting figure is a rectangle. It follows that the area of the parallelogram is the same as the area of the rectangle: : (parallelogram). thumb|right|upright|A parallelogram split into two equal triangles. However, the same parallelogram can also be cut along a diagonal into two congruent triangles, as shown in the figure to the right. It follows that the area of each triangle is half the area of the parallelogram: :A = \\frac{1}{2}bh (triangle). Similar arguments can be used to find area formulas for the trapezoid as well as more complicated polygons. ===Area of curved shapes=== ====Circles==== The formula for the area of a circle (more properly called the area enclosed by a circle\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Area\nContent: polygons). ===Triangle area=== ===Quadrilateral area=== In the 7th century CE, Brahmagupta developed a formula, now known as Brahmagupta's formula, for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral (a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle) in terms of its sides. In 1842, the German mathematicians Carl Anton Bretschneider and Karl Georg Christian von Staudt independently found a formula, known as Bretschneider's formula, for the area of any quadrilateral. ===General polygon area=== The development of Cartesian coordinates by René Descartes in the 17th century allowed the development of the surveyor's formula for the area of any polygon with known vertex locations by Gauss in the 19th century. ===Areas determined using calculus=== The development of integral calculus in the late 17th century provided tools that could subsequently be used for computing more complicated areas, such as the area of an ellipse and the surface areas of various curved three-dimensional objects. ==Area formulas== ===Polygon formulas=== For a non-self-intersecting (simple) polygon, the Cartesian coordinates (x_i, y_i) (i=0, 1, ..., n-1) of whose n vertices are known, the area is given by the surveyor's formula: :A = \\frac{1}{2} \\Biggl\\vert \\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1}( x_i y_{i + 1} - x_{i + 1} y_i) \\Biggr\\vert where when i=n-1, then i+1 is expressed as modulus n and so refers to 0. ====Rectangles==== thumb|right|upright|alt=A rectangle with length and width labelled|The area of this rectangle is .

The midpoints of the sides of any quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals form a rectangle. A parallelogram with equal diagonals is a rectangle. The Japanese theorem for cyclic quadrilateralsCyclic Quadrilateral Incentre- Rectangle with interactive animation illustrating a rectangle that becomes a 'crossed rectangle', making a good case for regarding a 'crossed rectangle' as a type of rectangle. states that the incentres of the four triangles determined by the vertices of a cyclic quadrilateral taken three at a time form a rectangle. The British flag theorem states that with vertices denoted A, B, C, and D, for any point P on the same plane of a rectangle: :\\displaystyle (AP)^2 + (CP)^2 = (BP)^2 + (DP)^2.

Thus the 10 degree cell with its lower left corner at 0,0 (latitude,longitude) is encoded 1000, and acts as a bin to contain all spatial data between 0 and 10 degrees north (actually, 0 and 9.999...) and 0 and 9.999... degrees east; the 10 degree cell with its lower left corner at 80 N, 170 E is encoded 1817, and acts as a bin to contain all spatial data between 80 and 90 degrees north and 170 and 179.999... degrees east. ===Subsequent recursive subdivision=== C-squares extends the initial WMO 10×10 square notation via a recursive series of \"cycles\", each 3 digits long (the final one may be 1 digit), separated by the colon character, the number of characters (and cycles) indicating the resolution encoded, as per these examples: *1000 ... 10×10 degree square (up to 1000×1000 km nominal) *1000:1 ... 5×5 degree square (up to 500×500 km nominal) *1000:100 ... 1×1 degree square (up to 100×100 km nominal) *1000:100:1 ... 0.5×0.5 degree square (up to 50×50 km nominal) *1000:100:100 ... 0.1×0.1 degree square (up to 10×10 km nominal) *1000:100:100:1 ... 0.05×0.05 degree square (up to 5×5 km nominal) (etc.) Cell size is typically selected to suit the nature (granularity and volume) of the data to be encoded, the overall spatial extent of the area in question (e.g. global to local), the desired spatial resolution of the resulting grid (smallest features/areas that can be differentiated from each other), and the computing resources available (numbers of cells to cover the same area increase by either\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Area\nContent: = 10−28 square meters.

In India, * 20 dhurki = 1 dhur * 20 dhur = 1 khatha * 20 khata = 1 bigha * 32 khata = 1 acre ==History== ===Circle area=== In the 5th century BCE, Hippocrates of Chios was the first to show that the area of a disk (the region enclosed by a circle) is proportional to the square of its diameter, as part of his quadrature of the lune of Hippocrates, but did not identify the constant of proportionality. Eudoxus of Cnidus, also in the 5th century BCE, also found that the area of a disk is proportional to its radius squared. Subsequently, Book I of Euclid's Elements dealt with equality of areas between two-dimensional figures. The mathematician Archimedes used the tools of Euclidean geometry to show that the area inside a circle is equal to that of a right triangle whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius, in his book Measurement of a Circle. (The circumference is 2r, and the area of a triangle is half the base times the height, yielding the area r2 for the disk.) Archimedes approximated the value of π (and hence the area of a unit-radius circle) with his doubling method, in which he inscribed a regular triangle in a circle and noted its area, then doubled the number of sides to give a regular hexagon, then repeatedly doubled the number of sides as the polygon's area got closer and closer to that of the circle (and did the same with circumscribed polygons). ===Triangle area=== ===Quadrilateral area=== In\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Perimeter\nContent: root of a polynomial equation with rational coefficients). So, obtaining an accurate approximation of is important in the calculation. The computation of the digits of is relevant to many fields, such as mathematical analysis, algorithmics and computer science. == Perception of perimeter== The perimeter and the area are two main measures of geometric figures. Confusing them is a common error, as well as believing that the greater one of them is, the greater the other must be. Indeed, a commonplace observation is that an enlargement (or a reduction) of a shape make its area grow (or decrease) as well as its perimeter. For example, if a field is drawn on a 1/ scale map, the actual field perimeter can be calculated multiplying the drawing perimeter by . The real area is times the area of the shape on the map. Nevertheless, there is no relation between the area and the perimeter of an ordinary shape. For example, the perimeter of a rectangle of width 0.001 and length 1000 is slightly above 2000, while the perimeter of a rectangle of width 0.5 and length 2 is 5. Both areas are equal to 1. Proclus (5th century) reported that Greek peasants \"fairly\" parted fields relying on their perimeters. However, a field's production is proportional to its area, not to its perimeter, so many naive peasants may have gotten fields with long perimeters but small areas (thus, few crops). If one removes a piece from a figure, its area decreases but its perimeter may not. In the case of very irregular shapes, confusion between the perimeter and the convex hull may arise. The convex hull of a figure may be visualized as the shape formed by a rubber band stretched around it.

It is noted for its harsh climate, with a wide daily variation on temperatures and its renowned jamón serrano (cured ham), its pottery, its surrounding archaeological sites, rock outcrops containing some of the oldest dinosaur remains of the Iberian Peninsula, and its famous events: La Vaquilla del Ángel during the weekend (Friday to Monday) closest to 10 July and \"Bodas de Isabel de Segura\" around the third weekend of February. Teruel is regarded as the \"town of mudéjar\" (Moorish-influenced architecture) due to numerous buildings designed in this style. All of them are comprised in the Mudéjar Architecture of Aragon which is a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO. Teruel's remote and mountainous location above sea level and its low population has led to relative isolation within Spain. A campaign group with the slogan Teruel existe (\"Teruel exists\") was founded in 1999 to press for greater recognition and investment in the town and the province. Due in part to the campaign, transport connections to Teruel were improved with the construction of a motorway between Zaragoza and Sagunto.

Established pursuant to Article Three of the U.S. Constitution in 1789, it has ultimate—and largely discretionary—appellate jurisdiction over all federal courts and state court cases involving issues of U.S. federal law, plus original jurisdiction over a small range of cases. In the legal system of the United States, the Supreme Court is generally the final interpreter of federal law including the U.S. Constitution, but it may act only within the context of a case in which it has jurisdiction. The Court may decide cases having political overtones, but does not have the power to decide political questions that are nonjusticiable, and its enforcement arm is in the executive rather than judicial branch of government. As established by the Judiciary Act of 1869, the Court normally consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices who are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The justices base their decisions on their interpretation of both legal doctrine and the precedential application of laws in the past. In most cases, interpreting the law is relatively clear-cut and the justices decide unanimously; however, in more complicated or controversial cases, the Court is often divided. In modern discourse, the justices of the Court are often categorized as having conservative, moderate, or liberal philosophies of law and of judicial interpretation. It has long been commonly assumed that justices' votes are a reflection of their judicial decision-making philosophy as well as their ideological leanings, personal attitudes, values, political philosophies, or policy preferences. A growing body of academic research has confirmed this understanding, as scholars have found that the justices largely vote in consonance with their perceived values.

It also has original jurisdiction over a narrow range of cases, specifically \"all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party.\"U.S. Constitution, Article III, Section 2. This was narrowed by the Eleventh Amendment to exclude suits against states that are brought by persons who are not citizens of that state. The court holds the power of judicial review, the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the Constitution. It is also able to strike down presidential directives for violating either the Constitution or statutory law. However, it may act only within the context of a case in an area of law over which it has jurisdiction. The court may decide cases having political overtones, but has ruled that it does not have power to decide non-justiciable political questions. Established by Article Three of the United States Constitution, the composition and procedures of the Supreme Court were initially established by the 1st Congress through the Judiciary Act of 1789. The court consists of nine justices: the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices. Justices have lifetime tenure, meaning they remain on the court until they die, retire, resign, or are impeached and removed from office.

During the 19th century, Congress changed the size of the Court on seven occasions, concluding with the Judiciary Act of 1869 which stipulates that the Court consists of the chief justice and eight associate justices. Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution grants plenary power to the president of the United States to nominate, and with the advice and consent (confirmation) of the United States Senate, appoint justices to the Supreme Court. Nominations to the Supreme Court are considered to be official when the Senate receives a signed nomination letter from the president naming the nominee, which is then entered in the Senate's record. Since 1789, there have been 165 formal nominations (of 146 persons) to the Supreme Court; 128 of them (123 persons) have been confirmed. The most recent nomination to be confirmed was that of Ketanji Brown Jackson in 2022. Of the 37 that were unsuccessful, 11 nominees were rejected in Senate roll-call votes, 12 were withdrawn by the president, and 14 lapsed at the end of a session of Congress. Six of these unsuccessful nominees were subsequently nominated and confirmed to other seats on the Court.

The procedures of the Court are governed by the U.S. Constitution, various federal statutes, and its own internal rules. Since 1869, the Court has consisted of one chief justice and eight associate justices. Justices are nominated by the president, and with the advice and consent (confirmation) of the U.S. Senate, appointed to the Court by the president. Once appointed, justices have lifetime tenure unless they resign, retire, or are removed from office. Established pursuant to Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution in 1789, it has original jurisdiction over a small range of cases, such as suits between two or more states, and those involving ambassadors. It also has ultimate appellate jurisdiction over all federal court and state court cases that involve a point of constitutional or statutory law. Most of the cases the Supreme Court hears are appeals from lower courts. Moreover, the Court has the power of judicial review, the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the Constitution or an executive act for being unlawful.

Established by Article III of the Constitution, the detailed structure of the court was laid down by the 1st United States Congress in 1789. Congress specified the Court's original and appellate jurisdiction, created 13 judicial districts, and fixed the initial size of the Supreme Court. The number of justices on the Supreme Court changed six times before settling at the present total of nine in 1869. A total of 115 justices have served on the Supreme Court since 1789. Justices have life tenure, and so they serve until they die in office, resign or retire, or are impeached and removed from office. Justices are nominated by the President of the United States and then must be confirmed by the United States Senate, before being officially appointed. A nomination to the Court is considered to be official when the Senate receives a signed nomination letter from the president naming the nominee, which is then entered in the Senate's record. There have been 37 unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States. Of these, 11 nominees were rejected in Senate roll-call votes, 11 were withdrawn by the president, and 15 lapsed at the end of a session of Congress. Six of these unsuccessful nominees were subsequently nominated and confirmed to seats on the Court. Additionally, although confirmed, seven nominees declined office and one died before assuming office. == 18th century == === George Washington === Among the six original nominees to the Supreme Court, George Washington nominated Robert H.

On matters of state law, the judgment of a state supreme court is considered final and binding in both state and federal courts. Generally, a state supreme court, like most appellate tribunals, is exclusively for hearing appeals of legal issues. Although state supreme court rulings on matters of state law are final, rulings on matters of federal law can be appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. Each state supreme court consists of a panel of judges selected by methods outlined in the state constitution. Among the most common methods for selection are gubernatorial appointment, non-partisan election, and partisan election, but the different states follow a variety of procedures. ==Role and powers== Under the system of federalism established by the United States Constitution, federal courts have limited jurisdiction, and state courts handle many more cases than do federal courts. Each of the fifty states has at least one supreme court that serves as the highest court in the state; two states, Texas and Oklahoma, have separate supreme courts for civil and criminal matters. The five permanently inhabited U.S. territories, as well Washington, D.C., each have comparable supreme courts. On matters of state law, the judgment of a state supreme court is considered final and binding in both state and federal courts. State supreme courts are completely distinct from any United States federal courts located within the geographical boundaries of a state's territory, or the federal-level Supreme Court.

A standard piece of database design guidance is that the designer should create a fully normalized design; selective denormalization can subsequently be performed, but only for performance reasons. The trade-off is storage space vs performance. The more normalized the design is, the less data redundancy there is (and therefore, it takes up less space to store), however,\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Salary survey\nContent: of companies - employees in all types of companies are interested in salaries, regardless of the type of work, region, industry, size, company ownership, etc. Such surveys aggregate data from a multitude of different companies. * Transparency of results - this method provides fast access to the most in-demand information to support decision-making; the information is also transparently depicted and easy to understand. * Results without providing company data - companies use the results of such surveys without actually providing their own data. This provides an opportunity to exploit information about the market without concerns over a loss of sensitive data. * Easy access to the required data - salary surveys of this type are accessible over the Internet. Companies have access to them anywhere with Internet connection: in offices, cafés, hotels, at home, etc. * Currentness - data is continuously added to this type of survey; the database is propagated with new data on a daily basis with old (year-old) data automatically replaced. * Financial accessibility - the survey method based on data from employees does not incur the same costs as surveys based on data from employers. These surveys are at a much more accessible price point for this reason. Small and medium enterprises primarily use this type of survey. * Real employee salaries and benefits - surveys based on data from employee are directly connected to the specific positions in which the employees work. The resulting data describes the situation of a specific employee and not the general situation in the company. Companies often declare benefits such as company mobile phones, but in practice an employee may actually only be eligible for such benefit in select positions and after working for the company for at least one year. ==== Disadvantages of salary surveys aggregating data\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Database\nContent: will be expressed in terms of a particular database model supported by the chosen DBMS. (The terms data model and database model are often used interchangeably, but in this article we use data model for the design of a specific database, and database model for the modeling notation used to express that design). The most popular database model for general- purpose databases is the relational model, or more precisely, the relational model as represented by the SQL language. The process of creating a logical database design using this model uses a methodical approach known as normalization. The goal of normalization is to ensure that each elementary \"fact\" is only recorded in one place, so that insertions, updates, and deletions automatically maintain consistency. The final stage of database design is to make the decisions that affect performance, scalability, recovery, security, and the like, which depend on the particular DBMS. This is often called physical database design, and the output is the physical data model. A key goal during this stage is data independence, meaning that the decisions made for performance optimization purposes should be invisible to end-users and applications. There are two types of data independence: Physical data independence and logical data independence. Physical design is driven mainly by performance requirements, and requires a good knowledge of the expected workload and access patterns, and a deep understanding of the features offered by the chosen DBMS. Another aspect of physical database design is security. It involves both defining access control to database objects as well as defining security levels and methods for the data itself. ===Models=== thumb|upright=2|Collage of five types of database models A database model is a type of data model that determines the logical structure of a database and fundamentally determines in which manner data\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Data hierarchy\nContent: or three fields, namely, day of month, month and year.

Human resource management function involves the recruitment, placement, evaluation, compensation, and development of the employees of an organization. Initially, businesses used computer-based information systems to: * produce paychecks and payroll reports; * maintain personnel records; * pursue talent management. Online recruiting has become one of the primary methods employed by HR departments to garner potential candidates for available positions within an organization. Talent management systems, or recruitment modules, offer an integrated hiring solution for HRMS which typically encompass: * analyzing personnel usage within an organization; * identifying potential applicants; * recruiting through company-facing listings; * recruiting through online recruiting sites or publications that market to both recruiters and applicants; * analytics within the hiring process (time to hire, source of hire, turnover); * compliance management to ensure job ads and candidate onboarding follows government regulations. The significant cost incurred in maintaining an organized recruitment effort, cross-posting within and across general or industry-specific job boards and maintaining a competitive exposure of availabilities has given rise to the development of a dedicated applicant tracking system (ATS) module. The training module provides a system for organizations to administer and track employee training and development efforts. The system, normally called a \"learning management system\" (LMS) if a standalone product, allows HR to track education, qualifications, and skills of the employees, as well as outlining what training courses, books, CDs, web- based learning or materials are available to develop which skills. Courses can then be offered in date specific sessions, with delegates and training resources being mapped and managed within the same system.

With release of Notes 4 in 1996, replication was changed so that it now occurs at field level. A database is a Notes Storage Facility (.nsf) file, containing basic units of storage known as a \"note\". Every note has a UniqueID that is shared by all its replicas. Every replica also has a UniqueID that uniquely identifies it within any cluster of servers, a domain of servers, or even across domains belonging to many organizations that are all hosting replicas of the same database. Each note also stores its creation and modification dates, and one or more Items. There are several classes of notes, including design notes and document notes. Design notes are created and modified with the Domino Designer client, and represent programmable elements, such as the GUI layout of forms for displaying and editing data, or formulas and scripts for manipulating data. Document notes represent user data, and are created and modified with the Notes client, via a web browser, via mail routing and delivery, or via programmed code. Document notes can have parent-child relationships, but Notes should not be considered a hierarchical database in the classic sense of information management systems. Notes databases are also not relational, although there is a SQL driver that can be used with Notes, and it does have some features that can be used to develop applications that mimic relational features.

For example: a hero proposes a journey to a dangerous place / he disguises himself / his disguise fools everybody / except for a common person of little account (a crone, a tavern maid or a woodcutter) / who immediately recognizes him / the commoner becomes the hero's ally, showing unexpected resources of skill or initiative. A theme does not belong to a specific story, but may be found with minor variation in many different stories. The story was described by Reynolds Price, when he wrote: > A need to tell and hear stories is essential to the species Homo sapiens – > second in necessity apparently after nourishment and before love and > shelter. Millions survive without love or home, almost none in silence; the > opposite of silence leads quickly to narrative, and the sound of story is > the dominant sound of our lives, from the small accounts of our day's events > to the vast incommunicable constructs of psychopaths.Price, Reynolds (1978). > A Palpable God, New York:Atheneum, p.3. In contemporary life, people will seek to fill \"story vacuums\" with oral and written stories. \"In the absence of a narrative, especially in an ambiguous and/or urgent situation, people will seek out and consume plausible stories like water in the desert.

The narrator's mother is the single reason why he takes a visit to Washington D.C. in order to try to work through the grief of losing his mother. Being the sole caretaker of his mother, he feels as though he “kept her alive longer than she wanted to be” because “families often hang on to [them] because they cannot let them go” (122). Grief, in this sense, is an overwhelming feeling of loss and despair, because the depression one goes through by not having someone they love around anymore as well the inability to accept death as a natural course of life. In order to work through his despair, the narrator finds ways in order to lessen the pain and to transfer some of the guilt he is feeling. He turns to roaming around Washington D.C. and conversing with his friend, Frank that “there are a lot of people who never get over certain things” like grief for example. “The past becomes their home. The dead become more real to them than the living – because there are more of the dead. They miss the dead, and when that happens, life stops” (21). This explanation perfects the theme of death of a family member. It helps to describe what happens when grief overpowers one's emotions and the reasons why one cannot overcome the death of a person. This is also a prevalent situation when the narrator parallels his life to that of Mary Todd Lincoln and Henry Adams. Throughout the story, while reading the diary of Mary Todd Lincoln, titled Mary Todd Lincoln: Her Life and Letters, the narrator makes connections between his grief\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Skin Books trilogy\nContent: jumping from a window. At the end of the book Mel is in charge of Saintstone and Leora is beginning to heal from her burns, as is the relationship between the blank and marked communities. == Themes == Religious Themes: One of the major themes of the books is the concept of faith and its effect on people's lives, after the author's own religious experiences. They also focus on the understanding of death and a sense of loss that changes between different beliefs, Broadway having taken inspiration from evangelical Christianity and ancient Egypt. The concepts of judgment, afterlife, and preservation are often presented with the marked's ceremonial weighing of the skin books and the blank's baptismal birthday ceremony. Social Themes: Another main focus of the books is the fear of 'otherness' and the unknown; the people of Saintstone have been taught to fear the blanks since childhood, while Featherstone have been taught to hate marked people. However, as Leora spends time with both societies, she learns they share many similarities and that it is the stories and lies told on both sides that keep them divided. Within both communities, there are those who see the views of the other, and who strive for acceptance and peace between the two people. Coming-of-age Themes: The book looks at two different issues within the coming-of-age bracket; challenging authority and self-expression. Throughout the series not everything is as it seems and characters must challenge their leaders, their teachings, and their own preconceptions to find the truth. There is also a focus on society's expectations on the looks and behaviour of the younger generation, from children to teens to young adults. This is most obviously demonstrated through the use of tattoos; Saintstone require all residents to mark their skin\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Dear Zoe\nContent: death. One theme is conflict. Tess has conflicts between Zoe's death and 9/11, confusing family relationships. Fate, Guilt, Escape and holding on. There are many conflicts that go on in the novel. The first major one is the tragedy of 9/11 and Zoe's death. Zoe happened to die on 9/11 but not from the terrorist attacks. This issue is something that the main character Tess often brings up. Another opposite conflict that Tess often compares is David and her dad Nick. She constantly brings up the differences between them. David is well put together and accomplished in his life. On the other hand, Tess's dad, Nick does not do much at all. They both treat her differently and in different manners. She is constantly comparing them to each other. In addition, she brings up the biological divide between her and her sisters. This causes constant internal conflict for Tess because she is treated differently. The many other themes of the books are fate, guilt, escaping and not being able to move on. The theme of fate is brought up a lot in this novel. Tess always Guilt is a theme that dominates most of the novel. The reader does not find out what happens to Zoe until the end but guilt is an underlying theme for Tess. She feels guilty not only for Zoe's death but also for leaving her other sister Emily home while she lives at her father's house. Which is the next theme of the book, escaping. Tess escapes from her reality by moving in with her biological father. She could not handle what was going on at home between her mother, Zoe and her own emotions to stay there. Tess also escapes with drugs. She experiments with marijuana with the next-door neighbor,\n\nID: 4\nTitle: The Innocents Abroad\nContent: draw a contrast between his own experiences and the often grandiose accounts in contemporary travelogues, which were regarded in their own time as indispensable aids for traveling in the region. In particular, he lampooned William Cowper Prime's Tent Life in the Holy Land for its overly sentimental prose and its often violent encounters with native inhabitants. Twain also made light of his fellow travelers and the natives of the countries and regions that he visited, as well as his own expectations and reactions. ==Themes== A major theme of the book is that of the conflict between history and the modern world. Twain continually encounters petty profiteering and trivializations of history as he journeys, as well as a strange emphasis placed on particular past events. He is either outraged, puzzled, or bored by each encounter. One example can be found in the sequence during which the boat has stopped at Gibraltar. On shore, the narrator encounters seemingly dozens of people intent on regaling him, and everyone else, with a bland and pointless anecdote concerning how a particular hill nearby acquired its name, heedless of the fact that the anecdote is, indeed, bland, pointless, and entirely too repetitive. Another example may be found in the discussion of the story of Abelard and Heloise, where the skeptical American deconstructs the story and comes to the conclusion that far too much fuss has been made about the two lovers. Only when the ship reaches areas of the world that do not exploit for profit or bore passers-by with inexplicable interest in their history, such as the early passage dealing with the ship's time at the Azores, is this attitude not found in the text. This reaction to those who profit from the past is found, in an\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Theme (narrative)\nContent: scenes in John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men are about loneliness. Thematic patterning is evident in One Thousand and One Nights, an example being the story of \"The City of Brass\". According to David Pinault, the overarching theme of that tale, in which a group of travelers roam the desert in search of ancient brass artifacts, is that \"riches and pomp tempt one away from God\".Pinault, David. 1992. Story- telling techniques in the Arabian nights. Leiden: Brill. p. 23. The narrative is interrupted several times by stories within the story. These include a tale recorded in an inscription found in the palace of Kush ibh Shaddad; a story told by a prisoner about Solomon; and an episode involving Queen Tadmur's corpse. According to Pinault, \"each of these minor narratives introduces a character who confesses that he once proudly enjoyed worldly prosperity: subsequently, we learn, the given character has been brought low by God ... These minor tales ultimately reinforce the theme of the major narrative\". ==Examples== Some common themes in literature are \"love,\" \"war,\" \"revenge,\" \"betrayal,\" \"patriotism,\" \"grace,\" \"isolation,\" \"motherhood,\" \"forgiveness,\" \"wartime loss,\" \"treachery,\" \"rich versus poor,\" \"appearance versus reality,\" and \"help from other-worldly powers.\" ==See also== * Literary element * Moral * Motif (narrative) ==Notes== ==References== * * * * ==Further reading== * Kerr, John (2022-07-06). \"The 3 Essential Elements of Plot Every Writer Should Know\".

In this novel, twin fetuses tell the story of their mild-mannered mother who abandons her controlling husband to start fresh in a small town in upstate New York. But her seemingly ideal neighbors are violently divided by the history Evie is teaching at the high school—the captivity and restoration of colonist Mary Rowlandson, a watershed conflict that leads our little narrators to ask big questions about love, survival, coveting the man next door and what exactly is a healthy appetite. Lauren Groff, author of Fates and Furies, writes \"I've been obsessed with Mary Rowlandson for 20 years. Micah Perks writes about her with fireworks. This is a warm, wild, hilarious, eccentric and moving book.\" ===Memoir=== Pagan Time (Counterpoint hardcover 2001, paperback forthcoming November, 2009) is a memoir about Perks' childhood growing up in an experimental commune school in the Adirondack Mountains during the sixties and early seventies. \"This wonderful book has distilled the sixties into a rare and potent tincture.

Some of the letter writers, including Gracie's brother Patrick and Ludwig's colleague Andrew, do not appear in the main narrative but are present at one or more of three large parties which bring together most of the main characters. The party scenes are not narrated but consist of unattributed snatches of conversation. The letter sections and party scenes constitute a mostly comic \"shadow novel\". ==Major themes== Accident is a major theme of the novel, which contains many coincidences and accidental occurrences, including several deaths. Austin calls himself an \"accidental man\" and sees himself always as a victim of other people and of his own bad luck. Late in the novel Matthew reflects on Austin's \"contamination\" of Mavis, and concedes that \"Austin had not really done this \"on purpose\"\", but that it was \" like so many other things in the story, an accident.\" Accident, in the form of the many coincidences in the plot, is also the source of much of novel's humour. The central moral theme of the novel is the individual's responsibility to others, as exemplified by the parable of the Good Samaritan. Before the action of the novel, two of the characters happened to witness events that evoke the parable. Garth saw a man being knifed on a New York City street and did not act, even though the man saw him and appealed for help. Matthew, observing a street protest in Moscow, saw another passerby joining the protesters in solidarity shortly before the police came and arrested them all. These events, to which their thoughts often turn, have had a profound effect on their views of themselves as moral agents. Ludwig is tormented throughout the novel by his decision to marry Gracie and stay\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Identify the theme of the following book.

Growling can be an expression of annoyance or fear, similar to humans. When annoyed or angry, a cat wriggles and thumps its tail much more vigorously than when in a contented state. In larger felids such as lions, what appears to be irritating to them varies between individuals. A male lion may let his cubs play with his mane or tail, or he may hiss and hit them with his paws.Lion#cite ref-105 Domestic male cats also have variable attitudes towards their family members, for example, older male siblings tend not to go near younger or new siblings and may even show hostility toward them. Hissing is also a vocalization associated with either offensive or defensive aggression. They are usually accompanied by a postural display intended to have a visual effect on the perceived threat. Cats hiss when they are startled, scared, angry, or in pain, and also to scare off intruders into their territory. If the hiss and growl warning does not remove the threat, an attack by the cat may follow. Kittens as young as two to three weeks will potentially hiss when first picked up by a human. ===Honeybees=== left|thumb|250px|Honeybees become pessimistic after being shaken Honeybees (\"Apis mellifera carnica\") were trained to extend their proboscis to a two-component odour mixture (CS+) predicting a reward (e.g., 1.00 or 2.00 M sucrose) and to withhold their proboscis from another mixture (CS−) predicting either punishment or a less valuable reward (e.g., 0.01 M quinine solution or 0.3 M sucrose).

Although most native speakers do not notice this, in most English dialects, the \"c/k\" sounds in these words are not identical: in , the sound is aspirated, but in , it is unaspirated. The words, therefore, contain different speech sounds, or phones, transcribed for the aspirated form and for the unaspirated one. These different sounds are nonetheless considered to belong to the same phoneme, because if a speaker used one instead of the other, the meaning of the word would not change: using the aspirated form in skill might sound odd, but the word would still be recognized. By contrast, some other sounds would cause a change in meaning if substituted: for example, substitution of the sound would produce the different word still, and that sound must therefore be considered to represent a different phoneme (the phoneme ). The above shows that in English, and are allophones of a single phoneme . In some languages, however, and are perceived by native speakers as significantly different sounds, and substituting one for the other can change the meaning of a word.

It is primarily associated with female cats soliciting males, and sometimes occurs in males when fighting with each other. A caterwaul is the cry of a cat in heat (estrus). ===Growl, snarl, hiss, and spit=== The growl, snarl, and hiss are all sounds associated with either offensive or defensive aggression. They are usually accompanied by a postural display intended to have a visual effect on the perceived threat. The communication may be directed at cats as well as other species: the puffed-up hissing and spitting display of a cat toward an approaching dog is a well- known behavior. Cats hiss when they are startled, scared, angry, or in pain; also to scare off intruders into their territory. If the hiss and growl warning does not remove the threat, an attack may follow. Kittens as young as two to three weeks may hiss and spit when first picked up by a human. Spitting is a shorter but louder and more emphatic version of hissing. === Howl, yowl, moan, and wail === These sounds are commonly used during threatening situations. Howls are more tonal, while moans are long and slowly modulated. On the other hand, anger wails are combined with growls, while yowls are similar to howls but longer.Schötz, S., 2015, June.

Due to the pressure to continue speaking, the speaker has to make a quick decision which word should be selected. This pressure leads to the speaker's attempt to utter the two words simultaneously, which resulted in the creation of a blend. According to Charles F. Hockett there are six possible blends of \"shout\" and \"yell\". Why did the speaker choose \"shell\" and not one of the alternatives? The speaker obeyed unconscious linguistic rules because he selected the blend, which satisfied the linguistic demands of these rules the best.

As predicted, French babies tended to prefer the modified nonsense French phrases, based solely on prosodic prominence, given by the location of the head direction parameter. Jusczyk et al. (1992) tested 9 month-olds, where they showed that infants are sensitive to acoustic correlates of main phrasal units that are present in the prosody of English sentences. The prosodic markers in the input are longer durations of the syllable that precedes a main phrasal boundary and declinations in fundamental frequency. == Computational modeling == Several language models have been used to show that in a computational simulation, prosody can help children acquire syntax. In one study, Gutman et al. (2015) build a computational model that used prosodic structure and function words to jointly determine the syntactic categories of words. The model assigned syntactic labels to prosodic phrases with success, using phrasal prosody to determine the boundaries of phrases, and function words at the edges for classification. The study presented the model of how early syntax acquisition is possible with the help of prosody: children access phrasal prosody and pay attention to words placed at the edges of prosodic boundaries. The idea behind the computational implementation is that prosodic boundaries signal syntactic boundaries and function words that are used to label the prosodic phrases. As an example, a sentence \"She's eating a cherry\" has a prosodic structure such as [She's eating] [a\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Syntactic bootstrapping\nContent: could use their knowledge of different parts of speech to distinguish the meaning of nonsense words in English. The results of Brown's experiment provided the first evidence showing that children could use syntax to infer meaning for newly encountered words and that they acquired grammar and semantics simultaneously. Brown's experiment was the beginning of the framework needed in order for the theory to thrive. This led developmental psycholinguists like Lila Gleitman, who coined the term syntactic bootstrapping in 1990, to argue that syntax was pivotal for language learning, as it also gives a learner clues about semantics. According to Gleitman's hypothesis, verbs are learned with a delay compared to other parts of speech because the linguistic information that supports their acquisition is not available during the early stages of language acquisition. The acquisition of verb meaning in children is pivotal to their language development. Syntactic bootstrapping seeks to explain how children acquire these words. == Logic and evidence == The syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis is based on the idea that there are universal/innate links between syntactic categories and semantic categories. Learners can therefore use their observations about the syntactic categories of novel words to make inferences about their meanings. This hypothesis is intended to solve the problem that the extralinguistic context is uninformative by itself to make conclusions about a novel word's meaning. For example, a child hears the sentence, “The cat meeped the bird.” If the child is familiar with the way arguments of verbs interact with the verb, he will infer that \"the cat\" is the agent and that \"the bird\" is the patient. Then, he can use these syntactic observations to infer that \"meep\" is a behaviour that the cat is doing to the bird. Children's ability to identify\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Charles F. Hockett\nContent: phrases or clauses) (b) the part of grammar ====Relationship between design features and animal communication==== Additionally, Dr. Stuart defends his postulation with references to famous linguist Noam Chomsky and University of New York psychologist Gary Marcus. Chomsky theorized that humans are unique in the animal world because of their ability to utilize Design Feature 5: Total Feedback, or recursive grammar. This includes being able to correct oneself and insert explanatory or even non sequitur statements into a sentence, without breaking stride, and keeping proper grammar throughout. While there have been studies attempting to disprove Chomsky, Marcus states that, \"An intriguing possibility is that the capacity to recognize recursion might be found only in species that can acquire new patterns of vocalization, for example, songbirds, humans and perhaps some cetaceans.\" This is in response to a study performed by psychologist Timothy Gentner of the University of California at San Diego. Gentner's study found that starling songbirds use recursive grammar to identify “odd” statements within a given “song.” However, the study does not necessarily debunk Chomsky's observation because it has not yet been proven that songbirds have the semantic ability to generalize from patterns. There is also thought that symbolic thought is necessary for grammar-based speech, and thus Homo Erectus and all preceding “humans” would have been unable to comprehend modern speech. Rather, their utterances would have been halting and even quite confusing to us, today. =====Hockett's \"design features\" of language and other animal communication systems===== The : Phonetics Laboratory Faculty of Linguistics, Philology and Phonetics published the following chart, detailing how Hockett's (and Altmann's) Design Features fit into other forms of communication, in animals: Feature Crickets Bee dancing Western meadowlark song Gibbon calls\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Part-of-speech tagging\nContent: term meaning \"fastens (a watertight door) securely\"). ===Tag sets=== Schools commonly teach that there are 9 parts of speech in English: noun, verb, article, adjective, preposition, pronoun, adverb, conjunction, and interjection. However, there are clearly many more categories and sub- categories. For nouns, the plural, possessive, and singular forms can be distinguished. In many languages words are also marked for their \"case\" (role as subject, object, etc.), grammatical gender, and so on; while verbs are marked for tense, aspect, and other things. In some tagging systems, different inflections of the same root word will get different parts of speech, resulting in a large number of tags. For example, NN for singular common nouns, NNS for plural common nouns, NP for singular proper nouns (see the POS tags used in the Brown Corpus). Other tagging systems use a smaller number of tags and ignore fine differences or model them as features somewhat independent from part-of-speech.Universal POS tags In part-of-speech tagging by computer, it is typical to distinguish from 50 to 150 separate parts of speech for English. Work on stochastic methods for tagging Koine Greek (DeRose 1990) has used over 1,000 parts of speech and found that about as many words were ambiguous in that language as in English. A morphosyntactic descriptor in the case of morphologically rich languages is commonly expressed using very short mnemonics, such as Ncmsan for Category=Noun, Type = common, Gender = masculine, Number = singular, Case = accusative, Animate = no. The most popular \"tag set\" for POS tagging for American English is probably the Penn tag set, developed in the Penn Treebank project.

The passwords are carefully generated random numbers. The random number generator is based on the RIPEMD-160 secure hash function, and it is seeded by hashing together the output of various shell commands. These provide unpredictability in the form of a system random number seed, access times of important system files, usage history of the host, and more. The random state is the 160-bit output of the hash function. The random state is iterated after each use by concatenating the old state with the current high-resolution timer output and hashing the result again. The first 72 bits of the hash output are encoded with a modified base64 scheme to produce readable passwords, while the remaining 88 bits represent the undisclosed internal state of the random number generator. In many fonts, the characters 0 and O or 1 and l and I are difficult to distinguish, therefore the modified base64 encoding replaces the three characters 01l by corresponding :, = and %. If for instance a zero is confused with a capital O by the user, the password verification routine will automatically correct for this. S/KEY uses sequences of short English words as passwords. OTPW uses by default a base64 encoding instead, because that allows more passwords to be printed on a single page, with the same password entropy. In addition, an average human spy needs over 30 seconds to write a 12-character random string into short-term memory, which provides a good protection against brief looks that an attacker might have on a password list. Lists of short words on the other hand are much faster to memorize.

A third option, if OpenSSL is available is to employ the function openssl_random_pseudo_bytes'.' ===Mechanical methods=== Yet another method is to use physical devices such as dice to generate the randomness. One simple way to do this uses a 6 by 6 table of characters. The first die roll selects a row in the table and the second a column. So, for example, a roll of 2 followed by a roll of 4 would select the letter \"j\" from the fractionation table below.Levine, John R., Ed.: Internet Secrets, Second edition, page 831 ff. John Wiley and Sons. To generate upper/lower case characters or some symbols a coin flip can be used, heads capital, tails lower case. If a digit was selected in the dice rolls, a heads coin flip might select the symbol above it on a standard keyboard, such as the '$' above the '4' instead of '4'. : 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 a b c d e f 2 g h i j k l 3 m n o p q r 4 s t u v w x 5 y z 0 1 2 3 6 4 5 6 7 8 9 ==Type and strength of password generated== Random password generators normally output a string of symbols of specified length.

Thus a password generated using a 32-bit generator is limited to 32 bits entropy, regardless of the number of characters the password contains. Note, however, that a different type of attack might succeed against a password evaluated as 'very strong' by the above calculation. ==Password generator programs and websites== A large number of password generator programs and websites are available on the Internet. Their quality varies and can be hard to assess if there is no clear description of the source of randomness that is used and if source code is not provided to allow claims to be checked. Furthermore, and probably most importantly, transmitting candidate passwords over the Internet raises obvious security concerns, particularly if the connection to the password generation site's program is not properly secured or if the site is compromised in some way. Without a secure channel, it is not possible to prevent eavesdropping, especially over public networks such as the Internet. A possible solution to this issue is to generate the password using a client-side programming language such as JavaScript. The advantage of this approach is that the generated password stays in the client computer and is not transmitted to or from an external server. ==See also== * Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator * Diceware * Hardware random number generator * Key size * Master Password (algorithm) * Password length\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Key stretching\nContent: used an iteration count of 25, a 12-bit salt and a variant of DES as the sub-function. (DES proper was avoided in an attempt to frustrate attacks using standard DES hardware.) Passwords were limited to a maximum of eight ASCII characters. While it was a great advancement for its time, CRYPT(3) is now considered inadequate. The iteration count, designed for the PDP-11 era, is too low, 12 bits of salt is an inconvenience but does not stop precomputed dictionary attacks, and the eight-character limit prevents the use of stronger passphrases. Modern password-based key derivation functions, such as PBKDF2, use a cryptographic hash, such as SHA-2, a longer salt (e.g. 64 bits) and a high iteration count. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommends a minimum iteration count of 10,000. \"For especially critical keys, or for very powerful systems or systems where user-perceived performance is not critical, an iteration count of 10,000,000 may be appropriate.” In 2009, a memory-intensive key strengthening algorithm, scrypt, was introduced with the intention of limiting the use of custom, highly parallel hardware to speed up key testing.Scryptscrypt: A new key derivation function, Colin Percival, BSDCan 2009, accessed 2011-2-1 In 2013, a Password Hashing Competition was held to select an improved key stretching standard that would resist attacks from graphics processors and special purpose hardware.

Schemes that implement two-factor authentication, by comparison, are growing in use. ==Password generation== The server is the computer that will perform the authentication. thumb|280px|S/KEY password generation # This step begins with a secret key W. This secret can either be provided by the user, or can be generated by a computer. Either way, if this secret is disclosed, then the security of S/KEY is compromised. # A cryptographic hash function H is applied n times to W, thereby producing a hash chain of n one-time passwords. The passwords are the results of the application of the cryptographic hash function: #:H(W), H(H(W)), ..., Hn(W). # The initial secret W is discarded. # The user is provided with the n passwords, printed out in reverse order: #:Hn(W), Hn−1(W), ..., H(H(W)), H(W). # The passwords H(W), H(H(W)), ..., Hn−1(W) are discarded from the server. Only the password Hn(W), the one at the top of the user's list, is stored on the server. ==Authentication== thumb|320px|S/KEY authentication After password generation, the user has a sheet of paper with n passwords on it.

Although it is based on DES, a well-studied block cipher, the LM hash has several weaknesses in its design. This makes such hashes crackable in a matter of seconds using rainbow tables, or in a few minutes using brute force. Starting with Windows NT, it was replaced by NTLM, which is still vulnerable to rainbow tables, and brute force attacks unless long, unpredictable passwords are used, see password cracking. NTLM is used for logon with local accounts except on domain controllers since Windows Vista and later versions no longer maintain the LM hash by default. Kerberos is used in Active Directory Environments. The major weaknesses of LAN Manager authentication protocol are:Rahul Kokcha # Password length is limited to a maximum of 14 characters chosen from the 95 ASCII printable characters. # Passwords are not case sensitive. All passwords are converted into uppercase before generating the hash value. Hence LM hash treats PassWord, password, PaSsWoRd, PASSword and other similar combinations same as PASSWORD. This practice effectively reduces the LM hash key space to 69 characters. # A 14-character password is broken into 7+7 characters and the hash is calculated for each half separately. This way of calculating the hash makes it dramatically easier to crack, as the attacker only needs to brute-force 7 characters twice instead of the full 14 characters. This makes the effective strength of a 14-character password equal to only 2\\times69^{7} \\approx 2^{44}, or twice that of a 7-character password, which is 3.7 trillion times less complex than the 69^{14} \\approx 2^{86} theoretical strength of a 14-character single-case password.

These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behaviour, and or cognition. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. The word \"robot\" was introduced to the public by Czech writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), published in 1920. The term \"robotics\" was coined by Isaac Asimov in his 1941 science fiction short-story \"Liar!\"According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term \"robotics\" was first used in the short story \"Liar!\" published in the May, 1941 issue of Astounding Science Fiction. == Nature of robotics == Robotics can be described as: * An applied science - scientific knowledge transferred into a physical environment. ** A branch of computer science - ** A branch of electrical engineering - ** A branch of mechanical engineering - * Research and development - * A branch of technology - == Branches of robotics == * Adaptive control - control method used by a controller which must adapt to a controlled system with parameters which vary, or are initially uncertain. For example, as an aircraft flies, its mass will slowly decrease as a result of fuel consumption; a control law is needed that adapts itself to such changing conditions. * Aerial robotics - development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, aircraft without a human pilot aboard. Their\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Robotics\nContent: text: Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of Electronics & Communication, computer science and engineering. Robotics involves the design, construction, operation, and use of robots. The goal of robotics is to design machines that can help and assist humans. Robotics integrates fields of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, information engineering, mechatronics engineering, electronics, biomedical engineering, computer engineering, control systems engineering, software engineering, mathematics, etc. Robotics develops machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. Robots can be used in many situations for many purposes, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including inspection of radioactive materials, bomb detection and deactivation), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive (e.g., in space, underwater, in high heat, and clean up and containment of hazardous materials and radiation). Robots can take any form, but some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is claimed to help in the acceptance of robots in certain replicative behaviors which are usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, or any other tasks mainly performed by a human. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio- inspired robotics. Certain robots require user input to operate, while other robots function autonomously. The concept of creating robots that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times, but research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century. Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed by various scholars, inventors, engineers, and technicians that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes, whether domestically,\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Cloud robotics\nContent: framework based on RoboEarth Engine developed by the robotics researcher at ETHZ. Within the framework, each robot connected to Rapyuta can have a secured computing environment (rectangular boxes) giving them the ability to move their heavy computation into the cloud. In addition, the computing environments are tightly interconnected with each other and have a high bandwidth connection to the RoboEarth knowledge repository. KnowRob is an extensional project of RoboEarth. It is a knowledge processing system that combines knowledge representation and reasoning methods with techniques for acquiring knowledge and for grounding the knowledge in a physical system and can serve as a common semantic framework for integrating information from different sources. is a large-scale computational system that learns from publicly available Internet resources, computer simulations, and real-life robot trials. It accumulates everything robotics into a comprehensive and interconnected knowledge base. Applications include prototyping for robotics research, household robots, and self-driving cars. The goal is as direct as the project's name—to create a centralised, always-online brain for robots to tap into. The project is dominated by Stanford University and Cornell University. And the project is supported by the National Science Foundation, the Office of Naval Research, the Army Research Office, Google, Microsoft, Qualcomm, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the National Robotics Initiative, whose goal is to advance robotics to help make the United States more competitive in the world economy. MyRobots is a service for connecting robots and intelligent devices to the Internet. It can be regarded as a social network for robots and smart objects (i.e. Facebook for robots). With socialising, collaborating and sharing, robots can benefit from those interactions too by sharing their sensor information giving insight on their perspective of their current state. is funded by the INTERREG IVA\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Robot App Store\nContent: C++, .NET, ROS, Java, Android Orbotix Sphero Java, Android TheCorpora Q.bo ROS WowWee RS Media WowWee Personality, C++ WowWee Rovio C++, .NET, Blackberry COD and JAD Innvo Labs Pleo Pleo Skit == Developer program == Individuals and companies can join the developer's program and submit their applications for approval and distribution.

The resource was driven by customer service requests for more information about apps that people had downloaded for their home robot projects. RobotAppStore.com's founder, Elad Inbar, said that more than 70 percent of their calls from customers were for more information. The topics cover the present and future of robots, including their components and concepts. It enables beginners and seasoned developers to learn about robotics acronyms and terminology, and read step-by-step application-development for many robots, vacuum cleaners and humanoids alike. == Funding == The company was funded by its founders since its inception. On December 10, 2012, the company announced its first external investment of $250,000 from Grishin Robotics, which was founded by Dmitry Grishin, the CEO and Chairman of Mail.ru Group.

It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid automation systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer. Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot). Robots are used extensively in industrial automation engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.Bolton, W. Mechatronics. Pearson; 6th ed. edition, 2015.

RoboBrain is a knowledge engine for robots which can be freely accessed by any device wishing to carry out a task. The database gathers new information about tasks as robots perform them, by searching the Internet, interpreting natural language text, images, and videos, object recognition as well as interaction. The project is led by Ashutosh Saxena at Stanford University. RoboEarth is a project that has been described as a \"World Wide Web for robots\" − it is a network and database repository where robots can share information and learn from each other and a cloud for outsourcing heavy computation tasks. The project brings together researchers from five major universities in Germany, the Netherlands and Spain and is backed by the European Union. Google Research, DeepMind, and Google X have decided to allow their robots share their experiences. ==See also== * Developmental robotics * Cognitive robotics * Evolutionary robotics ==References== ==External links== * IEEE RAS Technical Committee on Robot Learning (official IEEE website) * IEEE RAS Technical Committee on Robot Learning (TC members website) * Robot Learning at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems and the Technical University Darmstadt * Robot Learning at the Computational Learning and Motor Control lab * Humanoid Robot Learning at the Advanced Telecommunication Research Center (ATR) * Learning Algorithms and Systems Laboratory at EPFL (LASA) * Robot Learning at the Cognitive Robotics Lab of Juergen Schmidhuber at IDSIA and Technical University of Munich\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Open Robotics\nContent: text: Open Robotics is a nonprofit corporation headquartered in Mountain View, California. It is the primary maintainer of the Robot Operating System, the Gazebo simulator, and the Ignition libraries that are set to supersede Gazebo by 2025. Its stated mission is to support \"the development, distribution and adoption of open source software for use in robotics research, education, and product development\". Open Robotics funds its operations through the contributions of various public and private organizations, some of whom also engage its services for the development of various robotics applications, robotics R&D; and consulting. Notable sources of past and current funding include DARPA, NASA, Amazon, Bosch, Nvidia and the Toyota Research Institute. ==History== The beginnings of Open Robotics can be traced to Willow Garage, a robotics research lab and incubator created by Scott Hassan, an early Google engineer and billionaire technology entrepreneur. It was here that the first official Robot Operating System (ROS) distribution was released in May 2010, and quickly gained widespread adoption. Willow Garage was gradually dissolved in the ensuing years into several spin-offs, including the Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF), which was created in May 2012 to continue to shepherd the development of ROS and the Gazebo simulator. OSRF's initial backers included Willow Garage and DARPA, which awarded OSRF its first contract to support open source simulation software for the DARPA Robotics Challenge. In subsequent years, OSRF also provided support for NASA's Space Robotics challenge and the DARPA Subterranean Challenge. In September 2016, a taxable subsidiary named the Open Source Robotics Corporation (OSRC) was created to foster greater collaboration with industry. Together with OSRF, these two organizations came to be officially known as Open Robotics in May 2017.

Many of these can be viewed on websites such as YouTube, Hulu, CBS All Access, Disney+, HBO Max, and so on, in which people and companies alike can post content. However, many movies and television shows are not available for free legally, but rather can be purchased from sites such as iTunes and Amazon. * Audio - Music is the most common form of audio. Spotify has emerged as a popular way for people to listen to music either over the Internet or from their computer desktop. Digital content in the form of music is also available through Pandora and last.fm, both of which allow listeners to listen to music online for no charge. * Images - Photo and image sharing is another example of digital content. Popular sites used for this type of digital content includes Imgur, where people share self-created pictures, Flickr, where people share their photo albums, and DeviantArt, where people share their artwork. Popular apps that are used for images include Instagram and Snapchat. *Visual Stories - Stories are a new type of digital content that got introduced by Snapchat. Since then, stories as a format has been introduced in a couple of other platforms such as Facebook and Linkedin.

The culmination of such linkages could very well identify the tastes of a person in the community and make that person unique. User-generated content occurs when a product's customers create and disseminate online ideas about a product or the firm that markets it. These ideas are often in the form of text but also come in other forms such as music, photos, or videos. UGC has three key characteristics: (1) The contribution is by users of a product rather than the firm that sells this product; (2) it is creative in nature and the user adds something new; (3) it is posted online and generally accessible. == Media pluralism == According to Cisco Systems, in 2016 an average of 96,000 petabytes was transferred monthly over the Internet, more than twice as many as in 2012.Cisco Systems. 201.

Hard-hitting news is now taking a backseat to fluffy stories that get more shares and likes on social media platforms. News organizations like CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC are some of the most popular news destinations on the Internet. These major news organizations use platforms like Facebook and Twitter to their advantage by posting and sharing up-to-date content for their newsreaders. The overall research on journlaism and soical media has multiple homes, including connections to sociology, behavioral economic, and psychology, along with contemporary shadowing in political communication espicaially with media and communication studeis broadly. With the constant need to share up-to-date information, journalists now have to learn how to market their stories and work to get readers to click on and share their stories. Like the Television news consumers, online news consumers have particular reasons for following certain news organizations and sharing their content. The biggest result behind shares on social media is proximity, \"the general finding is that geographical proximity and the involvement of elite nations that are considered culturally proximate increase the news value of a story\". ==Real-time video posting== In May 2013, Twitter launched Twitter Amplify, allowing television networks and content rights holders to share video clips from major live broadcasts, with advertisers' names and messages playing before the clip. Facebook made changes to its algorithm and introduced video autoplay to drive video consumption and attract content from premium content rights holders such as NFL, NHL, Wimbledon and Fox Sports.

Based on interviews with 61 teenagers, conducted from December 2007 to February 2011, most of the teen participants from American high schools reported reading print newspapers only \"sometimes,\" with fewer than 10% reading them daily. The teenagers instead reported learning about current events from social media sites such as Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, and blogs. == Use as a news source across race, gender and political demographics == Just as variances occur in social media usage rates between different age demographics, similar variances occur across different racial, gender, and political demographics.

The new form of internet media that allow user-generated content has been called Web 2.0. The possibilities for user involvement has greatly increased the possibilities for networking, collaboration, and civic engagement. Protest movements, in particular, have benefited from an independent communication infrastructure. The circulation of messages on social media relies to a great extent on users who like, share, and re-distribute messages. This kind of circulation of messages is controlled less by the logic of market economics, and more by the principles of memetics. Messages are selected and recirculated based on a new set of criteria that are very different from the selection criteria of newspapers, radio, and television. People tend to share the messages that are psychologically appealing and attention-catching. Social media users are remarkably bad at evaluating the truth of the messages they share. In fact, studies show that false messages are shared more often than true messages because the false messages are more surprising and attention-catching. This has led to the proliferation of fake news and conspiracy theories on social media. Attempts to counter misinformation by fact checking has had limited effect. People prefer to follow the internet forums, pages, and groups that they agree with. At the same time, the media prefer topics that are already popular. This has led to the large scale occurrence of echo chambers and filter bubbles. A consequence of this is that the political arena has become more polarized because different groups of citizens are attending to different news sources, though the evidence of this effect is mixed. === Other forms of communication channels === Online political participation may affect the political standpoints of frequent media consumers, due to mass mediatization which is becoming increasingly prevalent.

Some of the most popular social media websites, with more than 100 million registered users, include Twitter, Facebook (and its associated Messenger), WeChat, ShareChat, Instagram, QZone, Weibo, VK, Tumblr, Baidu Tieba, and LinkedIn. Depending on interpretation, other popular platforms that are sometimes referred to as social media services include YouTube, QQ, Quora, Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, LINE, Snapchat, Pinterest, Viber, Reddit, Discord, TikTok, Microsoft Teams, and more. Wikis are examples of collaborative content creation. Social media outlets differ from traditional media (e.g. print magazines and newspapers, TV, and radio broadcasting) in many ways, including quality, reach, frequency, usability, relevancy, and permanence. Additionally, social media outlets operate in a dialogic transmission system (i.e., many sources to many receivers) while traditional media outlets operate under a transmission model (i.e., one source to many receivers). For instance, a newspaper is delivered to many subscribers, and a radio station broadcasts the same programs to an entire city. Since the dramatic expansion of the Internet, digital media or digital rhetoric can be used to represent or identify a culture. Studying the rhetoric that exists in the digital environment has become a crucial new process for many scholars. Observers have noted a wide range of positive and negative impacts when it comes to the use of social media. Social media can help to improve an individual's sense of connectedness with real or online communities and can be an effective communication (or marketing) tool for corporations, entrepreneurs, non-profit organizations, advocacy groups, political parties, and governments. Observers have also seen that there has been a rise in social movements using social media as a tool for communicating and organizing in times of political unrest. Social media can also be used to\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Uses and gratifications theory\nContent: sharing photos on Facebook. Thus, these needs are motivations that can predict photo sharing on Facebook. These specific motivations are: affection, attention seeking, disclosure, habit, information sharing, and social influence These motivations were identified using factor analysis. The same study also used correlation testing to determine that age correlates positively with the motivations of disclosure and social influence and that gender differences exist in the gratifications of habit and disclosure. Using Facebook to Listen to Music: In addition to photo sharing, Facebook also allows users to publish their music listening history and listen to music through the platform (San Pascual, 2013). Using a principal axis factor analysis, Krause, North, and Heritage (2014) found three primary motivations for using Facebook music listening applications: communication, entertainment, and habitual diversion. ====Twitter==== Twitter is an online micro-blogging platform that contains both mass-media functions and interpersonal communication options via sending tweets. Research has found a positive correlation between active time spent on Twitter and the gratification of a need for \"an informal sense of camaraderie\"—connection—with other users. Furthermore, the frequency of tweets and number of replies and public messages mediated the relationship between Twitter users. This helped increase both use and gratification of the media by satisfying the need for connection. ====Snapchat==== Snapchat is a photo-sharing social media platform with more than 178 million users worldwide. Similar to other forms of social media, people use Snapchat to fulfill specific media needs, in particular bonding social capital needs. Compared to social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, Snapchat is used more to fulfill private media needs. For example, Phua, Jin, and Kim found that Snapchat interactions were similar to interactions found in close interpersonal relationships. The application has been\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Spreadability\nContent: audience practices online. In other words, any user of a platform (that provides sharing possibilities) is emancipated as an individual who can informally, and instantaneously share information online. It is also important how the participatory culture and the act of sharing online \"tends to be a communal act of giving and taking that links us to other people\". == Prerequisites == Jenkins situates spreadability in a particular context. This concept is particularly contextualised in the social media era and the Web 2.0 culture. These two transformations can be considered prerequisites for the idea of spreadability to exist and for spreadable media to adopt such mechanisms to achieve spreadability. This new culture began at the beginning of the second millennium when the internet became an interactive space. This means there was a need for a platform or platforms where users could contribute and share information. Belk says this is how the \"Internet and especially Web 2.0 has brought about many new ways of sharing as well as facilitating older forms of sharing on a large-scale\".Belk, R. (2014). You are what you can access: Sharing and collaborative consumption online. Journal of Business Research. 67(8), p.1596 There is a strong emphasis on content production, but more concretely, user-generated content production. This is where the importance of social media (an effect of the Web 2.0) is relevant. Spreadable media is only possible when there is a platform where the content can be shared. As Jenkins puts it, \"spreadability emphasizes producing content in easy-to-share formats […] which makes it easier to spread videos [or any other material] across the Internet, and encouraging access points to that content in a variety of places\". Furthermore, as a result of this sharing community, the public has\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: What is the most commonly shared type of content on social media?\n\n[/INST]IDs: 7, 2, 5, 0</s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

The greatest OSH benefits stemming from the wider use of robotics should be substitution for people working in unhealthy or dangerous environments. In space, defense, security, or the nuclear industry, but also in logistics, maintenance, and inspection, autonomous robots are particularly useful in replacing human workers performing dirty, dull or unsafe tasks, thus avoiding workers' exposures to hazardous agents and conditions and reducing physical, ergonomic and psychosocial risks. For example, robots are already used to perform repetitive and monotonous tasks, to handle radioactive material or to work in explosive atmospheres. In the future, many other highly repetitive, risky or unpleasant tasks will be performed by robots in a variety of sectors like agriculture, construction, transport, healthcare, firefighting or cleaning services. Moreover, there are certain skills to which humans will be better suited than machines for some time to come and the question is how to achieve the best combination of human and robot skills. The advantages of robotics include heavy-duty jobs with precision and repeatability, whereas the advantages of humans include creativity, decision-making, flexibility, and adaptability. This need to combine optimal skills has resulted in collaborative robots and humans sharing a common workspace more closely and led to the development of new approaches and standards to guarantee the safety of the \"man-robot merger\".

Other goals sometimes include fast changes in production levels based on demand,SMLC 2011 optimization of the supply chain, efficient production and recyclability. In this concept, as smart factory has interoperable systems, multi-scale dynamic modelling and simulation, intelligent automation, strong cyber security, and networked sensors. The broad definition of smart manufacturing covers many different technologies. Some of the key technologies in the smart manufacturing movement include big data processing capabilities, industrial connectivity devices and services, and advanced robotics. thumb|463x463px| Graphic of a sample manufacturing control system showing the interconnectivity of data analysis, computing and automation. thumb|Advanced robotics used in automotive production|463x463px == Big data processing == Smart manufacturing utilizes big data analytics, to refine complicated processes and manage supply chains. Big data analytics refers to a method for gathering and understanding large data sets in terms of what are known as the three V's, velocity, variety and volume. Velocity informs the frequency of data acquisition, which can be concurrent with the application of previous data. Variety describes the different types of data that may be handled. Volume represents the amount of data. Big data analytics allows an enterprise to use smart manufacturing to predict demand and the need for design changes rather than reacting to orders placed. Some products have embedded sensors, which produce large amounts of data that can be used to understand consumer behavior and improve future versions of the product. == Advanced robotics == Advanced industrial robots, also known as smart machines, operate autonomously and can communicate directly with manufacturing systems. In some advanced manufacturing contexts, they can work\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Outline of robotics\nContent: text: The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to robotics: Robotics is a branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and computer science that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing. These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behaviour, and or cognition. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. The word \"robot\" was introduced to the public by Czech writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), published in 1920. The term \"robotics\" was coined by Isaac Asimov in his 1941 science fiction short-story \"Liar!\"According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term \"robotics\" was first used in the short story \"Liar!\" published in the May, 1941 issue of Astounding Science Fiction. == Nature of robotics == Robotics can be described as: * An applied science - scientific knowledge transferred into a physical environment. ** A branch of computer science - ** A branch of electrical engineering - ** A branch of mechanical engineering - * Research and development - * A branch of technology - == Branches of robotics == * Adaptive control - control method used by a controller which must adapt to a controlled system with parameters which vary, or are initially uncertain. For example, as an aircraft flies, its mass will slowly decrease as a result of fuel consumption; a control law is needed that adapts itself to such changing conditions. * Aerial robotics - development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, aircraft without a human pilot aboard.

The term was popularised in 2015 by Klaus Schwab, the World Economic Forum founder and executive chairman, and has since been used in numerous economic, political, and scientific articles in reference to the current era of emerging high technology. Schwab asserts that the changes seen are more than just improvements to efficiency, but express a significant shift in industrial capitalism. A part of this phase of industrial change is the joining of technologies like artificial intelligence, gene editing, to advanced robotics that blur the lines between the physical, digital, and biological worlds. Throughout this, fundamental shifts are taking place in how the global production and supply network operates through ongoing automation of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices, using modern smart technology, large-scale machine-to-machine communication (M2M), and the internet of things (IoT). This integration results in increasing automation, improving communication and self-monitoring, and the use of smart machines that can analyse and diagnose issues without the need for human intervention. It also represents a social, political, and economic shift from the digital age of the late 1990s and early 2000s to an era of embedded connectivity distinguished by the omni-use and commonness of technological use throughout society (e.g. a metaverse) that changes the ways humans experience and know the world around them. It posits that we have created and are entering an augmented social reality compared to just the natural senses and industrial ability of humans alone. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is expected to be followed by a Fifth Industrial Revolution. == History == The phrase Fourth Industrial Revolution was first introduced\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Deep tech\nContent: text: Deep technology (also deep tech or DeepTech) or hard tech is a classification of organization, or more typically startup company, with the expressed objective of providing technology solutions based on substantial scientific or engineering challenges. They present challenges requiring lengthy research and development, and large capital investment before successful commercialization. Their primary risk is technical risk, while market risk is often significantly lower due to the clear potential value of the solution to society. The underlying scientific or engineering problems being solved by deep tech and hard tech companies generate valuable intellectual property and are hard to reproduce. == Definition == The term deep tech has been present for decades, representing R&D; divisions at major defense and telecommunications corporations such as Raytheon Technologies, Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works, and Bell Labs, to the more modern definition which increasingly includes companies found in the venture capital ecosystem. The word doesn't refer to innovation itself, but to a category of startup companies that develop new products based “on scientific discovery or meaningful engineering innovation”. According to year 2019 research by the Boston Consulting Group and Hello Tomorrow, a French nonprofit that supports deep technology, the most prominent deep tech fields included advanced materials, advanced manufacturing, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, blockchain, robotics, photonics, electronics, and quantum computing. Global private investment in those fields increased more than 20% a year from 2015, and reached almost $18 billion in 2018. Possible fields for deep tech application include agriculture, life sciences, chemistry, aerospace and green energy. In business context, deep tech has three key attributes: potential for impact, a long time to reach market-ready maturity, and substantial requirement for capital. * Deep tech innovations are often radical and may create new markets or disrupt existing ones. Deep tech companies often address\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Robotics\nContent: text: Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of Electronics & Communication, computer science and engineering. Robotics involves the design, construction, operation, and use of robots. The goal of robotics is to design machines that can help and assist humans. Robotics integrates fields of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, information engineering, mechatronics engineering, electronics, biomedical engineering, computer engineering, control systems engineering, software engineering, mathematics, etc. Robotics develops machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. Robots can be used in many situations for many purposes, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including inspection of radioactive materials, bomb detection and deactivation), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive (e.g., in space, underwater, in high heat, and clean up and containment of hazardous materials and radiation). Robots can take any form, but some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is claimed to help in the acceptance of robots in certain replicative behaviors which are usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, or any other tasks mainly performed by a human. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio- inspired robotics. Certain robots require user input to operate, while other robots function autonomously. The concept of creating robots that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times, but research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century. Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed by various scholars, inventors, engineers, and technicians that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes, whether domestically,\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Robotics\nContent: apply the physiology and methods of locomotion of animals to the design of robots. For example, the design of BionicKangaroo was based on the way kangaroos jump. ===Quantum computing=== There has been some research into whether robotics algorithms can be run more quickly on quantum computers than they can be run on digital computers. This area has been referred to as quantum robotics. ==Education and training== Robotics engineers design robots, maintain them, develop new applications for them, and conduct research to expand the potential of robotics. Robots have become a popular educational tool in some middle and high schools, particularly in parts of the USA, as well as in numerous youth summer camps, raising interest in programming, artificial intelligence, and robotics among students. == Employment == thumb|upright|A robot technician builds small all-terrain robots (courtesy: MobileRobots, Inc.). Robotics is an essential component in many modern manufacturing environments. As factories increase their use of robots, the number of robotics–related jobs grow and have been observed to be steadily rising. The employment of robots in industries has increased productivity and efficiency savings and is typically seen as a long-term investment for benefactors. A paper by Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey found that 47 percent of US jobs are at risk to automation \"over some unspecified number of years\". These claims have been criticized on the ground that social policy, not AI, causes unemployment. In a 2016 article in The Guardian, Stephen Hawking stated \"The automation of factories has already decimated jobs in traditional manufacturing, and the rise of artificial intelligence is likely to extend this job destruction deep into the middle classes, with only the most caring, creative or supervisory roles remaining\". According to a GlobalData September 2021 report, the robotics industry was worth\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Manufacturing engineering\nContent: machining and welding. Automated manufacturing refers to the application of automation to produce goods in a factory. The main advantages of automated manufacturing for the manufacturing process are realized with effective implementation of automation and include: higher consistency and quality, reduction of lead times, simplification of production, reduced handling, improved work flow, and improved worker morale. Robotics is the application of mechatronics and automation to create robots, which are often used in manufacturing to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot). Robots are used extensively in manufacturing engineering. Robots allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications. ==Education== ===Manufacturing Engineers=== Manufacturing Engineers focus on the design, development and operation of integrated systems of production to obtain high quality & economically competitive products. These systems may include material handling equipment, machine tools, robots or even computers or networks of computers. ===Certification Programs=== Manufacturing engineers possess an associate's or bachelor's degree in engineering with a major in manufacturing engineering. The length of study for such a degree is usually two to five years followed by five more years of professional practice to qualify as a professional engineer.

Every time I visit, he's always making something. Present tense African American Vernacular English and Caribbean English use an invariant be to mark habitual or extended actions in the present tense. Some Hiberno-English in Ireland uses the construction do be to mark the habitual present. ==Romance languages== Romance languages like French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese do not have a grammatical form that is specific to the habitual aspect. In the past tense, they have a form called the imperfect, which combines the past tense with the imperfective aspect and indicates that a past ongoing process was habitual or continuous. == Turkish == In Turkish, the aorist (Turkish: geniş zaman, lit. \"broad time\") is a habitual aspect, and is similar to the English present simple. For example, the statement Et yemem (\"I do not eat meat\") informs the listener that the speaker is vegetarian, not merely that he happens not to be eating meat at that very moment. To imply the latter, the present progressive Et yemiyorum (\"I am not eating meat\") is used instead. == Cantonese == Cantonese, a Sinitic language, has a dedicated particle to express the habitual aspect, 開 hoi1, which follows the verb. This is unlike Mandarin and some other Sinitic languages, which have no grammatical indicators of the habitual aspect, but may express habituality via circumlocution. ==References== Category:Semantics Category:Grammatical aspects\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Sanskrit verbs\nContent: -> bhū·tvā́ and -bhū́·ya * √kṛ- -> kṛ·tvā́ and -kṛ́·t·ya * √gam- -> ga·tvā́ and -gám·ya ==Comprehensive example== The following table is a partial listing of the major verbal forms that can be generated from a single root.

The verb has nine relatively ordered prefixal “slots” and fourteen positions for suffixes. These positions are determined simply by the relative order in which co-occurring affixes can appear on the verb and do not correlate with semantically or functionally defined categories. Several affixes can appear in more than one position in the template, depending on various formal, semantic, and stylistic factors,Beck (2008b) and one position, suffix position 2, can accommodate more than one affix, the suffixes that can occupy this position being variably ordered with respect to one another. ===Verbal inflection=== Upper Necaxa dynamic verbs are inflected for three tenses (past, present, future), four aspects (imperfective, perfective, perfect, progressive), and four moods (indicative, optative, potential, irrealis). The tenses are marked exclusively by prefixes in the past and future and by a zero in the present, while three of the fours aspects (imperfective, perfective, and perfect) are marked by suffixes. The fourth aspect, the progressive, is realized through the use of inflectional compounds formed on the stative verb ma ‘be lying’.Beck (2011b) The indicative mood is zero-marked while the optative and potential are marked by the prefixes ka- and t-, respectively; the fourth mood, the irrealis, is marked by idiomatic combinations of morphemes borrowed from other parts\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Principal parts\nContent: aorist passive (VI), each listed in its first-person singular form: *Part I forms the entire present system, as well as the imperfect. *Part II forms the future tense in the active and middle voices. *Part III forms the aorist in the active and middle voices. *Part IV forms the perfect and pluperfect in the active voice, and the (exceedingly rare) future perfect, active. *Part V forms the perfect and pluperfect in the middle voice, and the (rare) future perfect, middle. *Part VI forms the aorist and future in the passive voice. One principal part can sometimes be predicted from another, but not with any certainty. For some classes of verbs, however, all principal parts can be predicted given the first one. ==Germanic languages== === English === Excluding four common irregular verbs, the principal parts of all other English verbs are the infinitive, preterite and past participle. All forms of these English verbs can be derived from the three principal parts. Four verbs have an unpredictable 3rd person singular form and the verb \"to be\" is so irregular it has seven separate forms. Lists or recitations of principal parts in English often omit the third principal part's auxiliary verb, rendering it identical to its grammatically distinct participial form. For example, the verb \"to take\" has the principal parts take–took–(have) taken. The verb \"to bet\" has bet–bet–(have) bet and the verb \"to break\" has break–broke–(have) broken. With irregular verbs the simple present 3S (he, she, it) is derived from infinitive+'s' with the exception of spelling changes such as: catch- catches, fly-flies and teach-teaches, which follow the same rules for regular 3S verbs. ====Examples of irregular verbs and their principal parts==== only one part\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Spanish grammar\nContent: the other person \"interrupted\" that state by entering (expressed through the preterite to suggest a completed action). === Present progressive and imperfect progressive === The present and imperfect progressive both are used to express ongoing, progressive action in the present and past, respectively. For example: * (I am doing my homework) * (We are studying) * (I was listening to the radio) * (He was cleaning his room) The present progressive is formed by first conjugating the verb or , depending on context, to agree with the subject, and then attaching a gerund of the verb that follows. The past (imperfect) progressive simply requires the or to be conjugated, depending on context, in imperfect, with respect to the subject. ==== Forming gerunds ==== To form the gerund of an verb, replace the of the infinitive with ; e.g. , , → , , . For or verbs, replace the or ending with ; e.g. , , → , , (note that undergoes the stem vowel change that is typical of verbs). In verbs whose stem ends with a vowel, the of the ending is replaced by : e.g. , , → , , . In verbs whose stem ends with —such as and —the stem vowel is raised to (as is typical of verbs), and this merges with the of the ending; e.g. , → , . === Subjunctive === The subjunctive of a verb is used to express certain connotations in sentences such as a wish or desire, a demand, an emotion, uncertainty, or doubt. ==== Present subjunctive ==== Normally, a verb would be conjugated in the present indicative to indicate an event in the present frame of time. * (I am very ambitious) *\n\nID: 5\nTitle: English grammar\nContent: past tense (wrote), and – though often identical to the past tense form – a past participle (written). Regular verbs have identical past tense and past participle forms in -ed, but there are 100 or so irregular English verbs with different forms (see list). The verbs have, do and say also have irregular third-person present tense forms (has, does , says ). The verb be has the largest number of irregular forms (am, is, are in the present tense, was, were in the past tense, been for the past participle). Most of what are often referred to as verb tenses (or sometimes aspects) in English are formed using auxiliary verbs. Apart from what are called the simple present (write, writes) and simple past (wrote), there are also continuous (progressive) forms (am/is/are/was/were writing), perfect forms (have/has/had written, and the perfect continuous have/has/had been writing), future forms (will write, will be writing, will have written, will have been writing), and conditionals (also called \"future in the past\"), so forms equivalent to future ones but with would instead of will. The auxiliaries shall and should sometimes replace will and would in the first person. For the uses of these various verb forms, see English verbs and English clause syntax. The basic form of the verb (be, write, play) is used as the infinitive, although there is also a \"to-infinitive\" (to be, to write, to play) used in many syntactical constructions. There are also infinitives corresponding to other aspects: (to) have written, (to) be writing, (to) have been writing. The second-person imperative is identical to the (basic) infinitive; other imperative forms may be made with let (let us go, or let's go; let them eat\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Slovene verbs\nContent: are also free morphemes, such as 'pretend', 'make mistakes' or 'love'. == Conjugation == Only the present indicative, the imperative and the non-finite forms are usually formed synthetically, by changing the form of the verb directly. All other forms are periphrastic (analytic), and are formed using auxiliary verbs or other additional words. Verbs are separated based on the ending vowel of their stem. === Present indicative === In present indicative, verbs have mostly the same endings across all declensions, but those following accentual type II D, III, IV, and some following II A can also have a special stylistically marked ending in third person plural. Those that have ending have the infix in second person plural and second / third person dual. The extra is added to the endings when the verb stem ends in a consonant. This causes changes to stems ending in or (which have an infinitive in ); these become and before the present tense endings. Present indicative endings Singular Dual Plural 1st 2nd 3rd 1st 2nd 3rd 1st 2nd 3rd All II D / III / IV / *Only if the stressed is open-mid The special ending in third person plural are always acute, but otherwise do not change the accent, except for the lengthening of short vowels. Verbs following II B, II C and III can be either acute or allow both accents in infinitive, but that does not affect the further accent changes. Verbs following II D, when accented on the same vowel on the stem as in infinitive also have the same accent. Dialectally, verbs in can also omit the infix, and it is common for speakers of Littoral dialect group to add the infix elsewhere, as well as to use the ending .\n\nID: 7\nTitle: English irregular verbs\nContent: getting or be finding a way\", making it equivalent to be- + gate, but it has moved away from gate in both form and meaning). There is also forsake–forsook–forsaken (this is from Old English forsōc \"to legally act for or affair for\", making it equivalent to for- + sake, but it has moved away from sake in both form and meaning). There is also beseech–besought–besought (this is from Old English besēcan \"to seek or inquire about\", making it equivalent to be- + seek, but it has moved away from seek in both form and meaning); however the form besought is now archaic, the verb normally being conjugated regularly (beseeched). ==List== The following is a list of irregular verbs that are commonly used in standard modern English. It omits many rare, dialectal, and archaic forms, as well as most verbs formed by adding prefixes to basic verbs (unbend, understand, mistake, etc.).

In French, the common term was premier sommeil or premier somme; in Italian, primo sonno; in Latin, primo somno or concubia nocte. He found no common word in English for the period of wakefulness between, apart from paraphrases such as first waking or when one wakes from his first sleep and the generic watch in its old meaning of being awake. In Old French an equivalent generic term is dorveille, a portmanteau of the French words dormir (to sleep) and veiller (to be awake). Because members of modern industrialised societies, with later evening hours facilitated by electric lighting, mostly do not practice interrupted sleep, Ekirch suggests that they may have misinterpreted and mistranslated references to it in literature. Common modern interpretations of the term first sleep are \"beauty sleep\" and \"early slumber\". A reference to first sleep in the Odyssey was translated as \"first sleep\" in the 17th century, but, if Ekirch's hypothesis is correct, was universally mistranslated in the 20th. The modern assumption that consolidated sleep with no awakenings is the normal and correct way for human adults to sleep, may lead people to consult their doctors fearing they have maintenance insomnia or other sleep disorders. If Ekirch's hypothesis is correct, their concerns might best be addressed by reassurance that their sleep conforms to historically natural sleep patterns. thumb|200px|Dymaxion sleep pattern described by Buckminster Fuller: Thirty minutes nap every six hours Buckminster Fuller described a regimen consisting of 30-minute naps every six hours.

For example, the word ('to sleep') is an intransitive verb, but may express different meaning when coupled with objects of prepositions as in \"to sleep with\". However, in Mandarin, is usually coupled with a pseudo- character , yet it is not entirely a cognate object, to express the act of resting. * ('I want sleep'). Although such usage of is not found among native speakers of Mandarin and may sound awkward, this expression is grammatically correct and it is clear that means 'to sleep/to rest' in this context. * ('I want to sleep') and ('I'm going to sleep'). In this context, ('to sleep') is a complete verb and native speakers often express themselves this way. Adding this particle clears any suspicion from using it with any direct object shown in the next example: * ('I want to have sex with her') and ('I want to sleep with her'). When the verb follows an animate direct object the meaning changes dramatically. The first instance is mainly seen in colloquial speech. Note that the object of preposition of \"to have sex with\" is the equivalent of the direct object of in Mandarin. One can also find a way around this verb, using another one which does not is used to express idiomatic expressions nor necessitate a pleonasm, because it only has one meaning: * ('I want \"to dorm) Nevertheless, is a verb used in high-register diction, just like English verbs with Latin roots. There is no relationship found between Chinese and English regarding verbs that can take pleonasms and cognate objects.

(2004) Sleep inspires insight. Nature 427. In a 1993 study at Harvard Medical School, psychologist Deidre Barrett, PhD, asked her students to imagine a problem they were trying to solve before going to sleep. It was found that her students were able to come up with rational solutions to their problems in their dreams. In this study published in Dreaming (Vol. 3, No. 2), 50% of the students that participated reported having dreams that addressed their chosen problems, while 25% came up with solutions in their dreams. ===Lack of sleep impairs creativity=== Some participants in a study went 32 hours without sleep while the control participants slept normally. When tested on flexibility and originality on figural and verbal tests, the sleep-deprived participants had severe and persistent impairments in their performance.Home, J.A. (1988) Sleep loss and \"divergent\" thinking ability. Sleep: Journal of Sleep Research & Sleep Medicine 11;6, pp. 528–536. A study tested 30 undergraduate students from seven different academic institutions, half majoring in art and half majoring in social sciences. Among all the participants, the higher the level of visual creativity, the lower the quality of their sleep was. The researchers also found that the higher the participants' level of verbal creativity, the more hours they slept and the later they went to sleep and woke up. ===Sleep and Humor === Under hypnotic-induced sleep, participants were much more likely to produce paraphrases of jokes that they had heard before and to spontaneously create new jokes (when compared with their performance while awake).Dittborn, J.M.

(See Yogi Berra#\"Yogi-isms\".) But one does hear educated people say \"my predictions about the future of politics\" for \"my predictions about politics\", which are equivalent in meaning. While predictions are necessarily about the future (at least in relation to the time the prediction was made), the nature of this future can be subtle (e.g., \"I predict that he died a week ago\"—the prediction is about future discovery or proof of the date of death, not about the death itself). Generally \"the future\" is assumed, making most constructions of this sort pleonastic. The latter humorous quote above about not making predictions – by Yogi Berra – is not really a pleonasm, but rather an ironic play on words. Alternatively it could be an analogy between predict and guess. However, \"It's déjà vu all over again\" could mean that there was earlier another déjà vu of the same event or idea, which has now arisen for a third time; or that the speaker had very recently experienced a déjà vu of a\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Idiom\nContent: a position to understand the whole if one understands the meanings of each of the parts that make up the whole. The following example is widely employed to illustrate the point: Understood compositionally, Fred has literally kicked an actual, physical bucket. The much more likely idiomatic reading, however, is non- compositional: Fred is understood to have died. Arriving at the idiomatic reading from the literal reading is unlikely for most speakers. What this means is that the idiomatic reading is, rather, stored as a single lexical item that is now largely independent of the literal reading. In phraseology, idioms are defined as a sub-type of phraseme, the meaning of which is not the regular sum of the meanings of its component parts.Mel'čuk (1995:167–232). John Saeed defines an idiom as collocated words that became affixed to each other until metamorphosing into a fossilised term.For Saeed's definition, see Saeed (2003:60). This collocation of words redefines each component word in the word-group and becomes an idiomatic expression. Idioms usually do not translate well; in some cases, when an idiom is translated directly word-for- word into another language, either its meaning is changed or it is meaningless. When two or three words are conventionally used together in a particular sequence, they form an irreversible binomial. For example, a person may be left \"high and dry\", but never \"dry and high\". Not all irreversible binomials are idioms, however: \"chips and dip\" is irreversible, but its meaning is straightforwardly derived from its components. == Mobility == Idioms possess varying degrees of mobility. Whereas some idioms are used only in a routine form, others can undergo syntactic modifications such as passivization, raising constructions, and clefting, demonstrating separable constituencies\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Exception that proves the rule\nContent: is punctuality.'

In 1958, linguist and anthropologist Dell Hymes presented his work to show that nonsense words can develop into something meaningful when in the right sequence. Russian-American linguist and literary theorist Roman Jakobson (1959) interpreted \"colorless green\" as a pale green, and \"sleep furiously\" as the wildness of \"a state-like sleep, as that of inertness, torpidity, numbness.\" Jakobson gave the example that if \"[someone's] hatred never slept, why then, cannot someone's ideas fall into sleep?\" John Hollander, an American poet and literary critic, argued that the sentence operates in a vacuum as it is without context. He went on to write a poem based on that idea, entitled Coiled Alizarine that was included in his book, The Night Mirror (1971). Years later, Hollander contacted Chomsky about whether the color choice of 'green' was intentional, however Chomsky denied any intentions or influences, especially the hypothesized influence from Andrew Marvell's lines from \"The Garden\" (1681). One of the first writers to have attempted to provide the sentence meaning through context is Chinese linguist Yuen Ren Chao (1997). Chao's poem, entitled Making Sense Out of Nonsense: The Story of My Friend Whose \"Colorless Green Ideas Sleep Furiously\" (after Noam Chomsky) was published in 1971. This poem attempts to explain what \"colorless green ideas\" are and how they are able to \"sleep furiously\". Chao interprets \"colorless\" as plain, \"green\" as unripened, and \"sleep furiously\" as putting the ideas to rest; sleeping on them overnight whilst having internal conflict with these ideas. British linguist Angus McIntosh was unable to accept that Chomsky's utterance was entirely meaningless because to him, \"colorless green ideas may well sleep\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Think of a phrase or idiom containing the word \"sleep\".\n\n[/INST]IDs: 4, 1</s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

The young woman stated many times that Mary stressed the importance of the priesthood, and focused attention on priests above others. Besides the two \"messages\", the visionaries forecast a \"warning\", a \"miracle\" and a \"punishment\" (if people do not correct their ways). The warning is described as a momentary stopping of time around the world, with all people then seeing the spiritual condition of their souls, and how they should amend their ways. Within a year of the warning, a miracle will take place. The miracle will leave a permanent sign in Garabandal, which can be seen and photographed, but not touched. The \"miracle\" will occur between March and May. The \"punishment\", or \"chastisement\", is conditional upon how humankind reacts to the preceding \"warning\" and \"miracle\". In addition to the predicted events, devotees believe a \"small\" miracle took place in the early morning hours of July 19, 1961. A photo, reproduced in all books and websites on Garabandal, is said to be taken from a film in which a Holy Communion wafer materialized in Conchita's open mouth, supposedly put there by an angel.

Eventually, Mary's father decides that she will marry Edward Neville, heir to become the Earl of Westmorland, but Mary refuses, and after her two aunts are arrested and convicted in the Gunpowder Plot, she leaves England and joins a monastery of Poor Clares at Saint Omer in northern France. The second section describes Mary's life in the monastery. Mary meets Father Keynes, who directs her to the Poor Clares monastery, saying that \"God has decided [on a convent] for you.\" However, she quickly realizes that she isn't well-suited to life at the convent, as her days become dull and fatiguing with little time for real spiritual contemplation. On Visitation Day, Mary receives an audience with the General Commissioner, who rules over the convents in Flanders and northern Germany, and she outlines to him a plan to create an English-speaking Poor Clares convent, to better benefit English-speaking nuns. Over the next several weeks and months, she helps direct the establishment of the new convent, and eventually, the project is completed. However, section two ends as Mary then receives a sign from God and realizes that she must leave the monastery. thumb|373x373px|Title page of Mary Ward, 1st edition, 1939The third and longest section begins with Mary returning to England and her family, and going back to normal life.

Many Christians have seen this as a fulfillment of prophecy, but skeptics tend to counter that Luke could be constructing his story to fit what he sees as fulfillments of prophecy, whether real or not. God's promise of a messiah from the house of David is foretold in 2 Samuel 7. It is significant that Luke states that Mary lives in Nazareth, considered a small backwater town. He thus has God's grace bestowed on a young, unmarried woman living in an insignificant town. Luke frequently has favor shown on women, sinners, and various \"unimportant\" people. Paul never mentions a virgin birth for Jesus, but in Romans speaks of him as the Son of God by virtue of his resurrection, and states he had a more than human nature. Luke here has Jesus' divine nature declared from the first moment of his conception. ==Mary and Elizabeth (1:39–56)== Mary then goes and visits her relative Elizabeth.

At the wedding Mary tries to convince Jesus to return to Nazareth but he ignores her. Some of the revellers later claim that Jesus turned water into wine but Mary questions their sobriety and did not personally witness this account. She later leaves in order to protect herself. Marcus visits Mary again to tell her that her son has been arrested and will be crucified. Mary travels to the city with Mary, one of Lazarus' sisters, and one of her son's followers, who promises protection, in order to witness the event, still believing there is something she can do to save him. As she witnesses the violent crucifixion she spies Marcus and realizes he has lured her there to be arrested like the rest of her son's followers. Knowing they believe she will never abandon her son before he dies, Mary and the others flee anyway, thinking only of saving her life. The three flee through the countryside and do desperate things in order to survive with Mary eventually losing all respect for her guide as she realizes he has no plan to save them. She also notices that she and Mary begin having the same dream in which a flood of water returns her now resurrected son to her. The trio eventually find safety and Mary, Lazarus's sister, departs to go home and live a normal life. Jesus's followers attempt to convince Mary that her son was the son of God and to claim that she was there to see his resurrection which she disputes.

Mary wouldn't tell George her wish but later in the film she told him she had wished to marry him and live in the house. The wish actually came true when in 1932, on the night of George and Mary's wedding, she bought it as their home. Through the years they redecorated the house, raised four children there, and lived the rest of their lives in the house. ===Bridge Street=== Bridge Street is at the north side of the town and connects to Genesee Street from the east next to the courthouse and runs out of the town via a toll bridge. Many other residents live up Bridge Street including the man who owns the tree George drives his car into when drunk. It is also the location of Giuseppe Martini's bar called \"Martini's\" (Romeo Restaurant), and behind the bar is the town's canal. The toll bridge on the outskirts of the town is the location where George thinks about committing suicide but is saved by guardian angel Clarence Odbody. When the two are in the water (after George jumps in to \"save\" Clarence) and the toll man shines his torch-light into the water, you can see many of the houses on Bridge Street above the riverbank. On the other side of the canal is a toll-house where George and Clarence go to get dry. In one shot of the toll-house, you can see many lit-up houses over the hills in the countryside, showing that the little town of Bedford Falls does actually spread out quite a bit. ===Railway station===\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Slammerkin\nContent: trade, with much of their time at leisure: drinking, attending the theatre, strolling through parks, and visiting friends. After a year together, Mary notices a decline in Doll, who has dark moods, little appetite, and drinks beyond excess. Although Doll often said \"a girl's clothes are her fortune\" and should never be sold, she begins pawning her clothing and often has trouble paying the rent. Mary finds their roles reversed as she often watches out for Doll and goes as far as to buy back her clothes. Mary becomes sick as a harsh winter approaches, and Doll convinces her to go to the Magdalen Hospital for penitents. Two months later, Mary is upset by a sermon about the choices women make, feeling that she has lacked any choice in her personal life. She leaves the hospital and finds Doll frozen to death in an alleyway with a bottle of gin. Mary finishes the last of the gin and takes a red ribbon from Doll's hair before covering her with a blanket. In their room, Mary finds Doll's clothing hidden under the floorboards, and is grieved to think that Doll died rather than sell them. The landlady says that Doll owed money and demands the clothes, but Mary fights with her and flees from the resident pimp. In fear for her life, Mary buys a modest dress and boards a coach for her mother's hometown of Monmouth, Wales. Lacking sufficient funds for the entire fare, Mary plays the part of a scared girl and maneuvers Joe Cadwaladyr into sleeping with her. He pays her out of guilt, and Mary borrows his writing things to forge a deathbed letter from Susan, asking for her mother's childhood friend Jane Jones to watch over Mary. === Part 2:\n\nID: 6\nTitle: The Secret Garden (musical)\nContent: the original Broadway production; the reworked London production altered this sequence by moving or omitting several scenes and songs. ===Act I=== Mary Lennox, a sickly 10-year-old English girl who has lived mostly in isolation in India since birth, dreams of English nursery rhymes and Hindi chants (\"Opening\").The lyrics are transcribed in the script and libretto, but not translated; phrased in poetic language, their approximate meaning is \"Lo, the season of magic/ The summer days/ Prayers, rituals, and artifacts/ May deliver her from sickness\". Survivors of a cholera outbreak discover Mary and inform her that her parents and nearly everyone she knew, including her Ayah, have died during the epidemic (\"There's a Girl\"). Mary is sent to live in England with her mysterious uncle Archibald Craven, a reclusive hunchback who has spent years grieving the death of his wife, Lily. Due to Archibald's introversion, the management of his manor house, Misselthwaite, is largely left to his manipulative brother, Dr. Neville Craven. The housekeeper, Mrs. Medlock, coldly welcomes Mary to Yorkshire (\"The House Upon the Hill\"). Due to Archibald and Mary's lingering grief, the house is haunted by ghosts from their pasts (identified in the libretto as \"dreamers\" who sometimes act as a Greek chorus of narrators, including the ghosts of Mary's parents, Rose and Albert). Lonely and misbehaving, Mary despises her new surroundings and her first night there hears echoes of crying voices (\"I Heard Someone Crying\"). The next morning, Mary meets Martha, a young chambermaid who encourages Mary to go play outside by telling her about the surrounding moorland and, in particular, a hidden garden (\"If I Had a Fine White Horse\").

She exercised her right to choose her own spouse: amongst Quakers during at time it was a high priority for women to be married suitably. This led to a fiery dispute between Mary and John Kendal, a Quaker disciplinarian, and to Mary writing \"Memoirs of M.M., Spinster of the Parish\", a letter to Kendall but also a social text showing how opinions differed concerning the education and conduct of women, the preparations for domestic life and particularly a woman's freedom to choose her spouse. Within the \"Memoirs\" Mary also wrote a short essay entitled \"the Pudding Making Mortal\". In this essay she argued that since \"accidents may happen to the best puddings in the world,\" every housewife should be taught science. It compares how she and other well-educated sisters would react to a bursting bag of pudding compared to others not so well-educated. She believed, similarly to her contemporary Elizabeth Carter, that intellectual rigour could be applied to cooking as in other areas of study. ===Marriage=== In 1767, at the age 34, Mary Morris married Thomas Knowles, a Quaker apothecary from Yorkshire, but she resolved not to become ‘a poor passive machine ... a mere smiling Wife.’ Despite her earlier resistance to marriage, she wed happily. By April 1768 she was six months pregnant. She experienced a difficult childbirth, and recorded her fears and sufferings through letters and heroic poems.

Renewable resources include sunlight, wind, the movement of water, and geothermal heat. Although most renewable energy sources are sustainable, some are not. For example, some biomass sources are considered unsustainable at current rates of exploitation. Renewable energy is often used for electricity generation, heating and cooling. Renewable energy projects are typically large-scale, but they are also suited to rural and remote areas and developing countries, where energy is often crucial in human development.World Energy Assessment (2001). Renewable energy technologies , p. 221. Renewable energy is often deployed together with further electrification, which has several benefits: electricity can move heat or objects efficiently, and is clean at the point of consumption. From 2011 to 2021, renewable energy has grown from 20% to 28% of global electricity supply. Use of fossil energy shrank from 68% to 62%, and nuclear from 12% to 10%. The share of hydropower decreased from 16% to 15% while power from sun and wind increased from 2% to 10%. Biomass and geothermal energy grew from 2% to 3%. There are 3,146 gigawatts installed in 135 countries, while 156 countries have laws regulating the renewable energy sector. In 2021, China accounted for almost half of the global increase in renewable electricity. Globally there are over 10 million jobs associated with the renewable energy industries, with solar photovoltaics being the largest renewable employer. Renewable energy systems are rapidly becoming more efficient and cheaper and their share of total energy consumption is increasing, with a large majority of worldwide newly installed electricity capacity being renewable.

Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be \"primarily social and political, not technological or economic\". Jacobson says that energy costs with a wind, solar, water system should be similar to today's energy costs. Many have since referred to Jacobson's work to justify advocating for all 100% renewables, however, in February, 2017, a group of twenty-one scientists published a critique of Jacobson's work and found that his analysis involves \"errors, inappropriate methods and implausible assumptions\" and failed to provide \"credible evidence for rejecting the conclusions of previous analyses that point to the benefits of considering a broad portfolio of energy system options.\" Critics state that the anti-nuclear arguments overestimate the benefits of renewable energy and fail to consider land per unit of energy inefficiencies and data that claims to forecast, \"...biomass, wind, and\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Outlook on Renewable Energy in America\nContent: text: Outlook on Renewable Energy in America is a comprehensive two-volume report, published in 2007 by the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), about the future of renewable energy in the United States.The Outlook On Renewable Energy In America It has been said that this report exposes a \"new reality for renewable energy in America\". Volume One of the report presents background information on government research conducted by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Energy Information Administration, Electric Power Research Institute and other institutions. It also collates information from industry associations such as the American Wind Energy Association, Solar Energy Industries Association, National Hydropower Association, as well as some non- profit organizations.Energy leaders call for long-term commitments to renewable resources Joint Outlook on Renewable Energy in America is the second volume of the report which presents a scenario compiled by the American renewable energy community. ACORE makes it clear that this report is not a forecast—it is a scenario of what is achievable if the country wants renewables to reach their full potential, and is willing to embrace the public policies to make that happen.Joint Outlook on Renewable Energy in America ACORE released an update of the report in March 2014, which assesses the marketplace and forecasts the future of each renewable energy technology sector from the perspectives of U.S. renewable energy trade associations. Each sector forecast is accompanied by a list of the trade association's specific policy recommendations that they believe might encourage continued industry growth.ACORE Releases Outlook for Renewable Energy in America: 2014, Jointly Authored by U.S. Renewable Energy Trade Associations ==Scenario== According to experts, renewable energy could provide up to 635 gigawatts (GW) of new electricity generating capacity by 2025 – a substantial contribution and potentially more than the nation's need\n\nID: 4\nTitle: List of countries by renewable electricity production\nContent: text: This article is a list of countries and territories by electricity generation from renewable sources every year.

The report, prepared by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, proposes $50 billion in tax credits for energy efficiency retrofits and renewable energy systems; $46 billion in direct government spending for public building retrofits, mass transit, freight rail, smart electrical grid systems, and renewable energy systems; and $4 billion for federal loan guarantees to help finance building retrofits and renewable energy projects. The Center believes that clean energy investments would yield about 300,000 more jobs than if the same funds were distributed among U.S. taxpayers. The clean energy investments would also have the added benefits of lower home energy bills and reduced prices for non-renewable energy sources, due to the reduced consumption of those energy sources. ==Worldwatch Institute/UNEP== Global efforts to tackle climate change could result in millions of \"green\" jobs over the coming decades, according to a 2008 study prepared by the Worldwatch Institute with funding from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The study found that the global market for environmental products and services is projected to double from $1.37 trillion per year at present to $2.74 trillion by 2020, with half of that market in efficient energy use.

REN21. 2008. In 2020, the global renewable energy market was valued at $881.7 billion and consumption grew 2.9 EJ. China was the largest contributor to renewable growth, accounting an increment of 1.0 EJ in consumption, followed by the US, Japan, the United Kingdom, India, and Germany. In Europe, renewable consumption incremented 0.7 EJ. thumb|400px|Renewable energy power growth in GW (2004-2011) ==Overview== Net-zero and 100% renewable energy global goals create market opportunities for renewable industries such as solar and wind energy and lithium-ion batteries. By 2050, it’s estimated that the renewable market will reach a value of one trillion dollars, the same size as the current oil market. In 2020, renewable sources incorporated into energy consumption at its fastest rate in two decades. During 2006/2007, several renewable energy companies went through high profile initial public offerings (IPOs), resulting in market capitalization near or above $1 billion. These corporations included the solar PV companies First Solar (USA), Trina Solar (USA), Centrosolar (Germany), and Renesola (U.K.), wind power company Iberdrola (Spain), and U.S. biofuels producers VeraSun Energy, Aventine, and Pacific Ethanol. Renewable energy industries expanded during most of 2008, with large increases in manufacturing capacity, diversification of manufacturing locations, and shifts in leadership.BTM Forecasts 340-GW of Wind Energy by 2013 By\n\nID: 7\nTitle: New Energy for America\nContent: text: thumb|New Energy For America New Energy for America was a plan led by Barack Obama and Joe Biden beginning in 2008 to invest in renewable energy sources, reduce reliance on foreign oil, address global warming issues, and create jobs for Americans. The main objective for the New Energy for America plan was to implement clean energy sources in the United States in order to switch from nonrenewable resources to renewable resources. The plan led by the Obama Administration aimed to implement short-term solutions to provide immediate relief from pain at the pump, and mid- to- long-term solutions to provide a New Energy for America plan. The goals of the clean energy plan hoped to: invest in renewable technologies that will boost domestic manufacturing and increase homegrown energy, invest in training for workers of clean technologies, strengthen the middle class, and help the economy. ==History== The term \"New Energy for America\" was first used on July 28, 2004, at an event in downtown Boston that gathered leaders from labor, government, business, and the environmental community to discuss how the \"new energy\" economy is critical for the future. This event raised awareness for the need for renewable energy and suggested that the new energy economy is about jobs, national security, public health, and the planet left behind for future generations. The plan was presented in the Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008. President Barack Obama in his inaugural address called for the expanded use of renewable energy to meet the twin challenges of energy security and climate change. In 2009, the Obama Administration made an effort to allow homeowners to finance solar and energy improvements without cost upfront, also known as PACE (Property-Assessed Clean Energy); They collaborated with the Middle Class Task Force to create a Policy Framework\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Generate a headline for the following article.

(1996). The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Writing Systems. Oxford: Blackwell. English punctuation has always had two complementary aspects: on the one hand, phonological punctuation linked to how the sentence can be read aloud, particularly to pausing;Parkes, M.B. (1992). Pause and Effect: An Introduction to the History of Punctuation in the West. Aldershot: Scolar Press. and on the other hand, grammatical punctuation linked to the structure of the sentence.Halliday, M.A.K. (1985). Spoken and Written Language. Oxford University Press. In popular discussion of language, incorrect punctuation is often seen as an indication of lack of education and of a decline of standards.Truss, L. (2003). Eats Shoots and Leaves. London: Profile ==Variants== === British and American styles === The two broad styles of punctuation in English are often called British (typically used in the UK, Ireland, and most of the Commonwealth of Nations) and American (also common in Canada and places with a strong American influence on local English, as in the Philippines). These two styles differ mainly in the way in which they handle quotation marks with adjacent punctuation, and the use or omission of the full point (period) with contraction abbreviations. ===Open and closed punctuation=== The terms open and closed punctuation have been applied to minimizing versus comprehensively including punctuation, respectively, aside from any dialectal trends. Closed punctuation is used in scholarly, literary, general business, and \"everyday\" writing. Open style dominates in text messaging and other short-form online communication, where more formal or \"closed\" punctuation can be misinterpreted as aloofness or even hostility. ;Open punctuation\n\nID: 1\nTitle: English punctuation\nContent: misinterpreted as aloofness or even hostility. ;Open punctuation Open punctuation eliminates the need for a period at the end of a stand-alone statement, in an abbreviation or acronym (including personal initials and post-nominal letters, and time-of-day abbreviations), as well as in components of postal addresses. This style also eschews optional commas in sentences, including the serial comma. Open punctuation also frequently drops apostrophes. Open punctuation is used primarily in certain forms of business writing, such as letterhead and envelope addressing, some business letters, and résumés and their cover letters. ;Closed punctuation In contrast, closed punctuation uses commas and periods in a strict manner. Closed style is common in presentations, especially in bulleted and numbered lists. It is also frequently used in advertising, marketing materials, news headlines, and signage.See for example: ==Usage of different punctuation marks or symbols== ===Frequency=== One analysis found the average frequencies for English punctuation marks, based on 723,000 words of assorted texts, to be as follows (as of 2013, but with some text corpora dating to 1998 and 1987): Excerpt from . Name Glyph Frequency (per 1000 words) Full stop (period) . 65.3 Comma , 61.3 Double quotation mark \" 26.7 Apostrophe / single quotation mark ' 24.3 Hyphen 15.3 Question mark ? 5.6 Colon : 3.4 Exclamation mark ! 3.3 Semicolon ; 3.2 ===Apostrophe=== The apostrophe , , sometimes called inverted comma in British English, is used to mark possession, as in \"John's book\", and to mark letters omitted in contractions, such as you're for you are. ===Brackets=== Brackets , are used for parenthesis, explanation or comment: such as \"John Smith (the elder, not his son)...\" ===Colon=== The\n\nID: 2\nTitle: A Bird came down the Walk\nContent: him a crumb, And he unrolled his feathers And rowed him softer home Than oars divide the ocean, Too silver for a seam, Or butterflies, off banks of noon, Leap, plashless, as they swim. ==Critique== Helen Vendler regards the poem as a \"bizarre little narrative\" but one that typifies many of Dickinson's best qualities. She likens the poet to a reporter observing a murderer in the act, and later, pretending fear that the murderer may be dangerous to herself and must be mollified by a \"crumb\". The bird takes flight and Vendler regards what follows - the description of the bird in flight - as \"the astonishing part of the poem\". Vendler notes that the poem typifies Dickinson's \"cool eye, her unsparing factuality, her startling similes and metaphors, her psychological observations of herself and others, her capacity for showing herself mistaken, and her exquisite relish of natural beauty\".Helen Vendler. Dickinson: selected poems and commentaries. Harvard University Press. pp. 157ff. Harold Bloom notes that the bird displays a \"complex mix of qualities: ferocity, fastidiousness, courtesy, fear, and grace\", and writes that the description of the bird's flight is that seen by the soul rather than the \"finite eyes\".Harold Bloom. Emily Dickinson. Infobase Publishing. pp. 34ff. Vendler observes that Dickinson wrote two versions of the middle portion of the poem. The version she sent to her literary mentor Thomas Wentworth Higginson has no punctuation after \"Head\" and a period after the word \"Cautious\". In Dickinson's personal copy, there is a comma (not a period) after \"Cautious\". In the first version then, the bird is cautious, but in the second version, it is the poet who is cautious. In the fair copy, both a period and\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Quotation marks in English\nContent: === Quotes are sometimes used for emphasis in lieu of underlining or italics, most commonly on signs or placards. This usage can be confused with ironic or altered-usage quotation, sometimes with unintended humor. For example, For sale: \"fresh\" fish, \"fresh\" oysters, could be construed to imply that fresh is not used with its everyday meaning, or indeed to indicate that the fish or oysters are anything but fresh. As another example, Cashiers' desks open until noon for your \"convenience\" could be interpreted to mean that the convenience was for the bank employees, not the customers. == Order of punctuation == With regard to quotation marks adjacent to periods and commas, there are two styles of punctuation in widespread use. These two styles are most commonly referred to as \"American\" and \"British\", or sometimes \"typesetters' quotation\" and \"logical quotation\". Both systems have the same rules regarding question marks, exclamation points, colons, and semicolons. However, they differ in the treatment of periods and commas. In all major forms of English, question marks, exclamation marks, semicolons, and any other punctuation (with the possible exceptions of periods and commas, as explained in the sections below) are placed inside or outside the closing quotation mark depending on whether they are part of the quoted material. A convention is the use of square brackets to indicate content between the quotation marks that has been modified from, or was not present in, the original material. === British style === The prevailing style in the United Kingdom called British style, logical quotation, and logical punctuation is to include within quotation marks only those punctuation marks that appeared in the original quoted material and in which the punctuation mark fits with the sense of\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Poetic devices\nContent: why the caged bird sings. * Question marks–In poetry, they are used to reflect a contemplative pause. * Exclamation marks–Indicates surprise, joy, and other strong emotions the poet is trying to emphasise or convey. * Ellipses–Leaving out part of a sentence or an event by substituting it with ellipses is a stylistic element. It represents an omission of words which helps in advancing the story. * Parentheses–It is technically used to separate and subordinate segments of a prose sentence. In poetry, parentheses draws attention to what is encased within them. In Cummings’ poem, 'Somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond', parentheses are used to convey a sense of intimacy and contemplativeness: “… your slightest look easily will unclose me though i have closed myself as fingers, you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens (touching skilfully, mysteriously) her first rose… (i do not know what it is about you that closes and opens; only something in me understands the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses) nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands\". * Enjambment–A lack of punctuation. It creates run on lines where a thought, phrase, or clause in a line of poetry does not come to an end break, but moves on to the following line. It may be employed to reinforce a central idea by eradicating the use of semi-colons, periods, or commas which may distract the reader. Enjambment is also employed to achieve a fast pace or rhythm. == Citations == == References == * Abrams, M. H., Harpham, G. G., & dawsonera. (2015).

One well known example, for comedic effect, is from A Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare (ignoring the punctuation provides the alternate reading). :Enter QUINCE for the Prologue :Prologue ::If we offend, it is with our good will. ::That you should think, we come not to offend, ::But with good will.

In a 1962 anthology of the magazine Wirkendes Wort, for example, one could read that participles were a frequently used means in the fine arts to vividly reproduce the content of a picture, but that the picture would be “even more expressive in language if the participle follows its antecedent” and still take the final position behind the verbal additions, as is the case with Menzel's pigeon picture title. ==References== Category:1844 paintings Category:Paintings in the Alte Nationalgalerie Category:Paintings by Adolph Menzel Category:Birds in art\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: What type of punctuation should be used at the end of the following sentence?

Mr. Bun offers to take her Spam instead, and asks for a dish containing a lot of Spam and baked beans. The waitress says the beans are not available; when Mr. Bun asks for a substitution of Spam, the waitress begins reading out the new dish's name. At several points, a group of Vikings in the restaurant interrupt conversations by loudly singing about Spam. The irate waitress orders them to shut up, but they resume singing more loudly. A Hungarian tourist comes to the counter, trying to order by using a wholly inaccurate Hungarian/English phrasebook (a reference to a previous sketch). He is rapidly escorted away by a police constable. The sketch abruptly cuts to a historian in a television studio talking about the origin of the Vikings in the café. As he goes on, he begins to increasingly insert the word \"Spam\" into every sentence, and the backdrop is raised to reveal the restaurant set behind.

This is almost always the main character (for example, Gabriel in James Joyce's \"The Dead\", Nathaniel Hawthorne's Young Goodman Brown, or Santiago in Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea). Certain third- person omniscient modes are also classifiable as using the third person, subjective mode when they switch between the thoughts and feelings of all the characters. In contrast to the broad, sweeping perspectives seen in many 19th- century novels, third-person subjective is sometimes called the \"over the shoulder\" perspective; the narrator only describes events perceived and information known by a character. At its narrowest and most subjective scope, the story reads as though the viewpoint character were narrating it; dramatically this is very similar to the first person, in that it allows in- depth revelation of the protagonist's personality, but it uses third-person grammar. Some writers will shift perspective from one viewpoint character to another, such as in Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time, or George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire. Free indirect speech is the presentation of a character's thoughts in the voice of the third-person narrator. Objective point of view employs a narrator who tells a story without describing any character's thoughts, opinions, or feelings; instead, it gives an objective, unbiased point of view. Often the narrator is self-dehumanized in order to make the narrative more neutral. This type of narrative mode is often seen outside of fiction in newspaper articles, biographical documents, and scientific journals. This narrative mode can be described as a \"fly-on-the- wall\" or \"camera lens\" approach\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Emmett Till\nContent: Wright said Till \"paid for his items and we left the store together\". In their 2006 investigation of the cold case, the FBI noted that a second anonymous source, who was confirmed to have been in the store at the same time as Till and his cousin, supported Wright's account.FBI (2006), p. 44. Author Devery Anderson writes that in an interview with the defense's attorneys, Bryant told a version of the initial encounter that included Till grabbing her hand and asking her for a date, but not Till approaching her and grabbing her waist, mentioning past relationships with white women, or having to be dragged unwillingly out of the store by another boy. Anderson further notes that many remarks prior to Till's kidnapping made by those involved indicate that it was his remarks to Bryant that angered his killers, rather than any alleged physical harassment. For instance, Mose Wright (a witness to the kidnapping) said that the kidnappers mentioned only \"talk\" at the store, and Sheriff George Smith only spoke of the arrested killers accusing Till of \"ugly remarks\". Anderson suggests that this evidence taken together implies that the more extreme details of Bryant's story were invented after the fact as part of the defense's legal strategy. After Wright and Till left the store, Bryant went outside to retrieve a pistol from underneath the seat of a car. Till and his companions saw her do this and left immediately. It was acknowledged that Till whistled while Bryant was going to her car. However, one witness, Roosevelt Crawford, maintained that Till's whistle was directed not at Bryant, but at the checkers game that was taking place outside the store.Anderson (2015) Carolyn's husband Roy Bryant was on an extended trip hauling shrimp to Texas and did not\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Killing of Markeis McGlockton\nContent: his SUV and searched for a disabled parking placard on Jacobs' vehicle.

McGlockton had not yet finished checking out when he overheard the store clerk being informed of the situation. Around 3:30 pm, video surveillance shows McGlockton walked out of the store and walked up to Drejka and shoved him to the ground and kept walking towards him. Three seconds later, Drejka pulled out a .40-caliber Glock, which he steadied with both hands. McGlockton immediately backed up when confronted with the firearm. As McGlockton backed up to his vehicle he began to turn towards the front of the store and away from Drejka. Drejka then fired a single shot striking McGlockton in the chest. After being shot, McGlockton ran back into the store and collapsed in front of his son. Paramedics arrived 19 minutes later and rushed McGlockton to Morton Plant Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 4:04 pm. ===Location=== The shooting occurred at Circle A Food Store located on Sunset Point Road in Clearwater.

In each instance there is unusually no taction contact suggesting his inability to extrapolate beyond the point of simply being with another. These events appear to be reviewed at a turning point in his life: whilst sitting beside a window in the dark listening to an owl hooting he has been remembering/imagining a first-love scenario but then finds he can’t continue and has to give up trying to (B12). === C === Voice C is that of old age. By this time he is content to seek shelter (and a degree of privacy) in public places like the Post Office (C9), the Public Library (C11) and the Portrait Gallery (C1). In the gallery he sees a face reflected in the glass and doesn’t quite recognise himself (C3). All his life he has lived in the past – all the voices are reflective – but now he is confronted with a reflection which is current, his own. The text with which the play closes, a ‘vision’ in the library where all the books have dissolved into dust (C12) evokes God’s admonition to Adam, “dust thou art; unto dust shalt thou return” (Genesis 3:19) == Genesis == Beckett initially wrote continuous prose for each of the three voice-aspects, then intercalated them into 36 verse paragraphs which are presented in a\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Leonard Shockley\nContent: that he had money and had no real reason to commit the robbery. Leonard and Harold brought their sister with them to drop her off at a friend's house; after leaving her, the two decided to commit a robbery in Boxiron. Leonard and Harold Shockley drove to a store in Boxiron owned by Sarah Hearne, a 39-year-old mother of three. They arrived at approximately 1:00 PM. Evidence suggests that Harold stayed in the car during the beginning of the crime, while Leonard entered the store with a knife in his waistband. When Hearne approached to serve Leonard, Leonard punched her in the face and proceeded to stab her multiple times in the chest and back. Subsequently, he cut her throat with the knife. During the attack, Harold entered the store and tried to open the cash register; he was unable to take any money because the cash register jammed. Leonard and Harold Shockley then fled the scene and drove away, with Leonard behind the wheel. During the attack, a witness, a black man named Clarence Bishop, saw Leonard and Harold's car outside of the store and heard a scuffle occurring inside. Bishop left the scene to get help from one of Hearne's neighbors. Bishop and the neighbor called the police and then returned to the scene of the crime. By the time they returned, Hearne had walked from the store to her house 95 feet away, where, in front of her stepfather, George Harris, she died from the injuries sustained in the attack. Harris told police that Hearne staggered back into the house and collapsed immediately. Harris summoned an ambulance, but by the time it arrived, Hearne had already died. ==Apprehension== Leonard and Harold returned to their home, where they were arrested at 9:15\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Narration\nContent: a narrator, third-person narration is described as having an anonymous narrator. Traditionally, third- person narration is the most commonly used narrative mode in literature. It does not require that the narrator's existence be explained or developed as a particular character, as would be the case with a first-person narrator. It thus allows a story to be told without detailing any information about the teller (narrator) of the story. Instead, a third-person narrator is often simply some disembodied commentary, rather than a fully developed character. Sometimes, third-person narration is called the \"he/she\" perspective, and, on even rarer occasions, author/omniscient point of view. The third-person modes are usually categorized along two axes. The first is the subjectivity/objectivity axis, with third person subjective narration involving one or more characters' personal feelings and thoughts, and third person objective narration not describing the feelings or thoughts of any characters but, rather, just the exact facts of the story. Third-person modes may also be categorized along the omniscient/limited axis. A third person omniscient narrator conveys information from multiple characters, places, and events of the story, including any given character's thoughts, and a third person limited narrator conveys the knowledge and subjective experience of just one character. Third person narration, in both its limited and omniscient variants, became the most popular narrative perspective during the 20th century. ==== Omniscient or limited ==== Omniscient point of view is presented by a narrator with an overarching perspective, seeing and knowing everything that happens within the world of the story, including what each of the characters is thinking and feeling. This narrative point of view has been the most commonly used in narrative writing; it is seen in countless classic novels, including works by Charles Dickens, Leo\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Swampy Cree language\nContent: means \"he went (there)\". 4) Aspect There is a potential prefix /kī/ (can, be able to) that precedes the root but follows both person and tense prefixes. The prefix /ati-/ indicates gradual onset (as opposed to sudden beginning). 4*) Some prefixes have more freedom in where they go, such as /pēci/ (in this direction, towards the speaker). 5) Location emphasis: When a locating expression is used at the beginning of a sentence, the verb contains a prefix /iši-/ as a sort of emphasis and agreement (approximately \"thus\" or \"so\"). Ellis describes it as being approximately \"At the store do you there work?\" If the locating expression does not precede the verb, /iši-/ is not used because it is relative root (so it refers to something that precedes it in the phrase). 6) Root 7) Reciprocal action Reciprocal action is expressed by the suffix /-ito-/, occurring between the stem and the normal inflection. 8) Inflectional suffix 9) Causative: The causative suffix /-hēw/ can be added to verbs in order to change it to a causative verb.

The core of this network was the robust TCP/IP network protocol. Thanks to efforts from Al Gore, the Internet grew beyond its military role when universities and commercial businesses were permitted to connect their networks to it. The main impetus for this was electronic mail, a far faster and convenient form of communication than a conventional letter and memo distribution, and the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). However, the Internet remained largely unknown to the general public, who were used to Bulletin Boards and services like Compuserve and America Online. This changed when Tim Berners-Lee devised a simpler form of Vannevar Bush's hypertext, which he dubbed the World Wide Web. \"The Web\" suddenly changed the Internet into a printing press beyond the geographic boundaries of physical countries; it was termed \"cyberspace\". Anyone with a computer and an Internet connection could write pages in the simple HTML format and publish their thoughts to the world. The Web's immense success also fueled the commercial use of the Internet. Convenient home shopping had been an element of \"visions of the future\" since the development of the telephone, but now the race was on to provide convenient, interactive consumerism. Companies trading through websites became known as \"dot coms\", due to the \".com\" suffix of commercial Internet addresses. The change of the century also lead to the fear and paranoia of Y2K, where it was hypothesized that the World's computers would glitch and cause havoc on banks, prisons, transit systems and more. === The world at the end of the century === By the end of the century, more technological advances and scientific discoveries been made than in all of preceding history.

Most traditional communication media, including telephone, radio, television, paper mail, and newspapers, are reshaped, redefined, or even bypassed by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as email, Internet telephone, Internet television, online music, digital newspapers, and video streaming websites. Newspaper, book, and other print publishing have adapted to website technology or have been reshaped into blogging, web feeds, and online news aggregators. The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interaction through instant messaging, Internet forums, and social networking services. Online shopping has grown exponentially for major retailers, small businesses, and entrepreneurs, as it enables firms to extend their \"brick and mortar\" presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely online. Business-to-business and financial services on the Internet affect supply chains across entire industries. The Internet has no single centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies. The overarching definitions of the two principal name spaces on the Internet, the Internet Protocol address (IP address) space and the Domain Name System (DNS), are directed by a maintainer organization, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols is an activity of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. In November 2006, the Internet was included on USA Todays list of the New Seven Wonders. == Terminology == The word internetted was used as early as 1849, meaning interconnected or interwoven. nineteenth-century use as an adjective.

It consists of millions of smaller domestic, academic, business and governmental networks, which together carry various information and services, such as email, online chat, file transfer, and the interlinked web pages and other documents of the World Wide Web. Contrary to some common usage, the Internet and the World Wide Web are not synonymous: the Internet is the system of interconnected computer networks, linked by copper wires, fibre-optic cables, wireless connections etc.; the Web is the contents, or the interconnected documents, linked by hyperlinks and URLs. The World Wide Web is accessible through the Internet, along with many other services including e-mail, file sharing and others described below. Toward the end of the 20th century, the advent of the World Wide Web marked the first era in which most individuals could have a means of exposure on a scale comparable to that of mass media. Anyone with a web site has the potential to address a global audience, although serving to high levels of web traffic is still relatively expensive. It is possible that the rise of peer-to-peer technologies may have begun the process of making the cost of bandwidth manageable. Although a vast amount of information, imagery, and commentary (i.e. \"content\") has been made available, it is often difficult to determine the authenticity and reliability of information contained in web pages (in many cases, self-published). The invention of the Internet has also allowed breaking news stories to reach around the globe within minutes. This rapid growth of instantaneous, decentralised communication is often deemed likely to change mass media and its relationship to society. \"Cross-media\" means the idea of distributing the same message through different media channels.

After the development of the Internet in 1969, its use remained limited to communications between scientists and within government, although use of email and boards gained popularity among those with access. It did not become a popular means of communication until the 1990s. In 1993 the US federal government opened the Internet to commerce and the creation of HTML formed the basis for universal accessibility.Ferdinand, P. (2000). The Internet, democracy and democratization. Democratization, 7(1): 1–17 ===Major innovations=== The Internet has played a critical role in modern life as a typical feature of most Western households, and has been key in the democratization of knowledge. It not only constitutes arguably the most critical innovation in this trend thus far; it has also allowed users to gain knowledge of and access to other technologies. Users can learn of new developments more quickly, and purchase high-tech products otherwise only actively marketed to recognized experts. Some have argued that cloud computing is having a major effect by allowing users greater access through mobility and pay-as-you-use capacity.Barton, Mike.

The concept has meant that smaller firms are able to use the internet to reach markets that would only have been available to the larger firms before. The modern ability and desire of companies to grow globally means that management teams are tasked with monitoring teams and employees who may be based abroad. Global Reach refers to the growing need for communication between these firm factions. While telephone calls are common, firms are increasingly turning to emails namely for time efficiency which allows business to grow as it becomes faster to carry out requests of customers and executives within the company. The time efficiency involved in online communication between the firm and customers and transactions allows for business to move faster and for companies to concentrate their energy in other sectors. With the economic environment constantly altering, businesses need to find ways to move forward alongside new technologies. However, failing to keep up with technological advances can cause firms to lose out to competitors which may use these technical benefits more efficiently. == Wider benefits == Whilst the above improvements have proven vital and beneficial to firms, consumers have also enjoyed the rewards of such expansion through cheaper pricing due to increased competition, access to a wider array of goods and better quality products due to the ability of firms to contact a bigger range of suppliers. Popular online sale sites which have become a staple of the internet due to Global Reach initiatives has also allowed the general public to access foreign markets, most commonly those of small home-run firms. The economic concept of the multiplier affect applies in some such cases\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Internet\nContent: text: The Internet (or internet) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the interlinked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing. The origins of the Internet date back to the development of packet switching and research commissioned by the United States Department of Defense in the late 1960s to enable time-sharing between computers. The primary precursor network, the ARPANET, initially served as a backbone for the interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1970s to enable resource sharing. The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies and the merger of many networks. The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s, as well as the advent of the World Wide Web, marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet,\"#3 1982: the ARPANET community grows\" in 40 maps that explain the internet , Timothy B. Lee, Vox Conversations, 2 June 2014. Retrieved 27 June 2014. and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and mobile computers were connected to the network.

Belch & Belch explained that the internet is mostly a non- personal form of communication as consumers absorb information online with no personal contact between the consumer and the organizations that are providing the information on their websites. However, as the internet develops, it is including personal communication as consumers interact with marketers online as well as communicate and share information with one another through the use of social media. The Internet allows multimedia documents to be shared among its users. approximately 30 million websites have been registered worldwide and 650 million were connected to the Internet. The Internet as a marketing tool can be used to reach and inform customers directly, create brand loyalty, and build relationships. Online advertising includes elements such as: graphic images as website banners, pop-up advertisements, homepage restyling and anchor deals (co-operation between two organizations ). ====Interactivity==== Interactivity is a characteristic feature of the Internet that was described in 1996 by John Deighton. He argued that in the then-new Internet business environment, clients rather than the marketers usually start the interaction, by actively looking for the information that they need. Moreover, personal responses of customers will be collected by corporations and their individual demands will be met according to their desires. On the one hand, traditional media are \"push\" formats where marketers broadcast their messages to customers, but do not allow direct feedback. The interaction between the two parties is few and far between. On the other hand, Internet media have the attribute of \"pull\" where customers have the freedom to search for whatever they wish. For instance, whenever a consumer types \"flower\" Google's search engine, an advertisement of a specific flower shop might be placed on the top or bottom of the search result page by the Google\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Internet\nContent: 1945 by the United States War Department in a radio operator's manual, and 1974 as the shorthand form of Internetwork. Today, the term Internet most commonly refers to the global system of interconnected computer networks, though it may also refer to any group of smaller networks. When it came into common use, most publications treated the word Internet as a capitalized proper noun; this has become less common. This reflects the tendency in English to capitalize new terms and move to lowercase as they become familiar. The word is sometimes still capitalized to distinguish the global internet from smaller networks, though many publications, including the AP Stylebook since 2016, recommend the lowercase form in every case. In 2016, the Oxford English Dictionary found that, based on a study of around 2.5 billion printed and online sources, \"Internet\" was capitalized in 54% of cases. The terms Internet and World Wide Web are often used interchangeably; it is common to speak of \"going on the Internet\" when using a web browser to view web pages. However, the World Wide Web or the Web is only one of a large number of Internet services, a collection of documents (web pages) and other web resources, linked by hyperlinks and URLs. == History == In the 1960s, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) funded research into time-sharing of computers. J. C. R. Licklider proposed the idea of a universal network while leading the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) at ARPA.

It is of unknown etymology and is not necessarily related to the raining animals phenomenon.Anatoly Liberman, Raining Cats and Dogs The phrase (with \"polecats\" instead of \"cats\") has been used at least since the 17th century.Richard Brome (1652), The City Witt: \"It shall rain dogs and polecats.\" Robert Laurence, Raining Cats And Dogs . Accessed on 2009-07-28. == Etymology == A number of possible etymologies have been put forward to explain the phrase. Raining cats and dogs at The Phrase Finder site. Accessed on 2009-07-28. One possible explanation involves the drainage systems on buildings in 17th-century Europe, which were poor and may have disgorged their contents, including the corpses of any animals that had accumulated in them, during heavy showers. This occurrence is described in Jonathan Swift's 1710 poem \"Description of a City Shower\": Another explanation is that \"cats and dogs\" may be a corruption of the Greek word , referring to the waterfalls on the Nile, possibly through the old French word ('waterfall'). In old English, meant a cataract or waterfall. \"Cats and dogs\" may come from the Greek expression , which means “contrary to experience or belief”; if it is raining cats and dogs, it is raining unusually hard. There is no evidence to support the theory that the expression was borrowed by English speakers. An online rumor largely circulated through email claimed that, in 16th-century Europe, animals could crawl into the thatch of peasant homes to seek shelter from the elements and would fall out during heavy rain.

Another use of the term is to \"cause an enormous fight or flap, usually by revealing a controversial fact or secret\", or in other words: to do something suddenly or unexpectedly which leaves the people worried or angry. The key point being the making explicit a controversial or precarious paradigm or settlement. ==History and usage== The phrase originally referred to the disturbance likely to be created by putting a cat inside a dovecote (or dove house). This disturbance is caused by the cat's tendency to hunt and kill the birds, only made easier by their close proximity. ===Similarity in other languages and cultures=== In Dutch, the same meaning is expressed in the proverb \"De knuppel in het hoenderhok gooien,\" literally translated to \"Throwing the bat into the chicken shed.\" Whilst being similar to other idioms, in this case there is an element of aggression, and a power differential becomes the key element in the undesirability. The Spanish- language version of the phrase is alborotar a todo el palomar, \"to disturb the dovecote\". In Russian, there is a proverb similar in meaning \"пустить козла в огород\" (let a goat into the garden). In colonial India, a popular pastime was to put a wild cat in a pen with pigeons. Bets would be made on how many birds the cat would bring down with one paw-swipe. The period of the British colonisation of India may have introduced this concept, and hence the phrase to the English language. In French-language, similar meaning is expressed\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Cat–dog relationship\nContent: ==Cultural impact== The phrase \"fight like cats and dogs\" reflects a natural tendency for the relationship between the two species to be antagonistic. Other phrases and proverbs include \"The cat is mighty dignified until the dog comes by\" and \"The cat and dog may kiss, but are none the better friends.\" Eugene Field's children's poem, \"The Duel,\" projects and amplifies the real-life antipathy between cats and dogs onto a stuffed gingham dog and a stuffed calico cat who had an all-night fight during which they \"ate each other up.\" In Fam Ekman's children's book Kattens Skrekk (The Cat's Terror), a cat visits a museum to find that all of the artworks, like Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo, have been replaced by parodies featuring dogs. The only piece not converted is The Scream which \"symbolizes the cat's terror in the face of so many dogs.\" The American animated television series CatDog features the adventures of the protagonist, CatDog, a genetically altered creature with the head of a dog on one side of its body and the head of a cat on the other. The episodes frequently play on \"cats and dogs being what they are\" to incorporate \"a lot of running and chasing.\" The comedy films Cats & Dogs, released in 2001, and its sequel Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore, released in 2010, both project and amplify the above- mentioned antipathy between dogs and cats into an all-out war between the two species wherein cats are shown as being out-and-out enemies of humans, whereas dogs are shown as being more sympathetic to humans.

There are earlier idiomatic allusions in 15th century Burgundian sources.

In the following century, Jean-Antoine de Baïf has the version faire comme le singe, tirer les marrons du feu avec la patte du chat in his Mimes, enseignements et proverbes (1575) and John Florio includes the saying in his collection of idioms Second Frutes (1591).Elizabeth Dawes, \"Pulling the chestnuts out of the fire\" in Animals and the symbolic in mediaeval art and literature (ed) L.A.J.R. Houwen, Groningen 1997, pp.155-69 However, the earliest surviving texts relating the story date from the mid-16th century and some of these have a puppy in place of a cat as the monkey's victim. Johannes Sambucus reports it as happening recently in the Dutch town of Bergen op Zoom in his Emblemata (1564). The Latin poem there continues, 'A small monkey gave us an example noteworthy and amusing for its cunning. For, when he saw the chestnuts buried in the hearth, he began to brush the ash aside but, afraid of the burning coals, he suddenly seized the foot of a sleeping puppy and stole it out.'

This invalid form of argument, labeled AAA-2 among syllogisms, commits the fallacy of the undistributed middle: it says nothing about all things having four legs (the middle term) and thus the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, even if the premises are true. The politician's syllogism similarly says nothing about all known \"somethings\" that could be done. As is common with fallacious undistributed middle arguments, it can also be seen as the fallacy of affirming the consequent when restated as an equivalent hypothetical syllogism: #To improve things, things must change. #We are changing things. #Therefore, we are improving things. ==See also== *List of fallacies ==References== Category:Political terminology Category:Yes Minister Category:Informal fallacies\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: What is the meaning of the following idiom?

On the early morning of September 27, 2017, firefighters were alerted that a one-story house and two sheds were burning in Proba. They quickly traveled to the indicated location and extinguished the flames, where they found three bodies: the couple that occupied the home (aged 54 and 56), as well as a 90-year-old disabled grandfather. Forensic experts who were present at the scene immediately noticed that the couple had been stabbed, while the elderly man, who was unable to get up due to his health condition, had died from smoke inhalation. ==Arrest, trial and imprisonment== While they were still trying to deal with the fire, firefighters met with a peculiar obstacle: one of the homeowners, German Christan, stood in the doorway to the burning house because \"he wanted to get a better look\". He was arrested for interfering, but after it was learned by the other villagers' testimony that Christan and the deceased victims had problems resulting in death threats, specifically about a 300-ruble debt that the former owned and never returned, the police decided to search Christan's house. When they did so, they discovered the victims' stolen moped, as well as blood stains on Christan's black jacket, which he hadn't bothered to wash since he believed the stains weren't noticeable. Christan was taken to the police station, but denied his guilt in the murders, despite the overwhelming evidence against him. While investigating his past, the authorities recalled the mysterious death of Vladimir K. in 2014, who had died in suspiciously similar circumstances. The evidence from that case was reexamined, and the detectives reclassified it as murder, as a closer look revealed that the fire had been started deliberately, not accidentally as it was previously believed.

In 2016, a non-fatal fire at a Shepherd's Bush tower block spread to six floors via flammable external cladding.

The first two fire engines (\"pumps\") arrived six minutes later. The initial incident commander said that the fire was visible at this point as a \"glow\" in the window. A further two pumps were also dispatched. Any residents of the tower who called the fire service were told to remain in their flat unless it was affected, which is the standard policy for high-rise fires, as each flat should be fireproofed from its neighbours.

Before fire occurs, a family should practice evacuating the home, and when fire occurs the family must leave the residence immediately (within two minutes). Sources of flame, like matches, should be kept out of children's reach. Stoves, ovens, space-heaters, and candles must not be left unattended, and flammable objects must be kept at least 30 cm away from open flames. Fire extinguishers should be stored in the kitchen, where most house fires start. To prevent children from getting burned, water temperature must not be set too high when taking baths or washing hands, nonflammable sleepwear should be worn, back burners should be used when cooking something on the stove, and hot foods, drinks, and irons should be kept away from the edge of counter and table. Oven mitts and potholders must be used in handling hot containers. Care should be taken when taking hot foods out of microwave ovens, and covers should be opened gently to reduce the risk of steam burns. ==Treatment== The most important first action is to stop the burning process. The source of the burn should promptly be removed (or the patient removed from the source). If the person is on fire, he/she must be told to stop, drop and roll, or extinguish the fire by covering them with heavy blanket, wool, coat, or rug. Burning clothing should be removed as should all jewelry that could act as a tourniquet as swelling occurs, but burned clothing stuck to the skin must not be removed. Cooling the burn with cold running water has been shown to be beneficial if accomplished within 30 minutes of the injury.

Damage was estimated to be at least $4 million. The fire started on November 30, 2017 when a local resident, John Gomes, attempted to imitate a metalworking technique from the History Channel series Forged in Fire. Flames from a burn-barrel he was using were spread by wind to adjacent structures. Gomes was charged with counts of felony arson and reckless endangerment, and released after posting bail. Around 28 people, including Gomes, were displaced. No deaths were reported. There were minor injuries, including a firefighter who was taken to a hospital. Gomes pleaded guilty to arson and in June 2018, he was sentenced to one year in jail and a $600,000 fine. ==References== Category:Arson in New York (state) Cohoes fire Cohoes fire Fire 2017 Cohoes fire Cohoes fire\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Generate a sentence using the following words in the correct order: house on fire\n\n[/INST]IDs: 0, 1, 2, 4</s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

When learning relative terms such as large and small or narrow and wide she simultaneously learned both words in the pair, whereas most people acquire either the marked or the negative form first, and never mistakenly used one term in a pair to mean the other. Although she had difficulty with different pairs of relative and relational terms on tests, she showed significantly greater comprehension outside of test settings. In early 1975 Genie began to use a type of ungrammatical sentence with a subject–verb–(object or subject)–verb–({subject or object}–verb) construction. Curtiss wrote that some of these sentences could have been grammatically correct if they included relative pronouns, but that others looked like two separate sentences which Genie had simply combined while removing some of the nouns. At around the same time Genie also began to produce ungrammatical sentences containing a copula, first with utterances such as \"Is Akron\" and later including verbs without the -ing suffix such as \"Boy is pinch\". Curtiss wrote that approximately one half of these types of ungrammatical sentences were Genie's responses to people who told her to, \"speak in sentences\", which she would interpret as being asked to include a form of to be in a sentence. Curtiss noted that Genie also produced some grammatical sentences with copulas, such as \"Glass is clear\". Despite mastering word order, Genie still had difficulty with distinguishing between simple actor–action–object sentences. In 1975, when given the sentences \"The girl pulls the boy\" or \"The boy pulls the girl\" and asked to point to the corresponding picture, her answers would either be all correct or all incorrect.

Nevertheless, non-finite clauses imply a \"doer\" of the verb, even if that doer is indefinite \"someone or something\". For example, * We enjoy singing. (ambiguous: somebody sings, possibly ourselves) * Licking the cream was a special treat (somebody licked the cream) * Being awarded the prize is a great honour (someone is or may be awarded the prize) Often the \"doer\" is clearly signalled * We enjoyed singing yesterday (we ourselves sang) * The cat responded by licking the cream (the cat licked the cream) * His heart is set on being awarded the prize (he hopes he himself will be awarded the prize) * Meg likes eating apricots (Meg herself eats apricots) However, the \"doer\" may not be indefinite or already expressed in the sentence. Rather it must be overtly specified, typically in a position immediately before the non-finite verb * We enjoyed them singing. * The cat licking the cream was not generally appreciated. * We were delighted at Paul being awarded the prize.

For example, in the sentence His energy surprised everyone, His energy is the agent, even though it does not have most of the typical agent-like qualities such as perception, movement, or volition. Even Dowty's solution fails for verbs expressing relationships in time: (1) April precedes May. vs: (2) May follows April. Here what is agent and what is patient must be specified for each individual verb. The grammatical agent is often confused with the subject, but the two notions are quite distinct: the agent is based explicitly on its relationship to the action or event expressed by the verb (e.g. \"He who kicked the ball\"), whereas the subject is based on a more formal title using the theory of the information flow (e.g. \"Jack kicked the ball\"). In the sentence \"The boy kicked the ball\", the boy is the agent and the subject. However, when the sentence is rendered in the passive voice, \"The ball was kicked by the boy\", the ball is the grammatical subject, but the boy is still the agent. Many sentences in English and other Indo-European languages have the agent as subject. The use of some transitive verbs denoting strictly reciprocal events may involve a conflation of agent and subject. In the sentence \"John met Sylvia\", for example, though both John and Sylvia would equally meet Dowty's definition of a Proto-Agent, the co-agent Sylvia is downgraded to patient because it is the direct object of the sentence.Givóm, Tom. 2001.

During the aggressive model scenario, the adult would begin to play with the Bobo doll and then start to show aggressive behavior towards the doll. Examples of this aggressive behavior include hitting or punching the Bobo doll and using the toy mallet to hit the Bobo doll in the face. The aggressive model would also verbally assault the Bobo doll yelling, \"Sock him,\" \"Hit him down,\" \"Kick him,\" \"Throw him in the air,\" or \"Pow.\" After about 10 minutes, the experimenter returned to the room, dismissed the adult model, and took the child into another playroom. The non-aggressive adult model simply played with other toys for the entire 10-minute period. In this situation, the model ignored the Bobo doll entirely; the child was taken out of the room. The following experiment stage was performed with the child and experimenter in another room filled with interesting toys such as trucks, dolls, and a spinning top. The child was invited to play with them. After 2 minutes of playtime, the child was told they were no longer allowed to play with the toys because they were reserved for other children. This was done to build frustration. They were told they could instead play with the toys in the experimental room (the aggressive and non-aggressive toys). The child was allowed to play for 20 minutes in the experimental room while an experimenter evaluated the child's play. The first measure recorded was based on physical aggression such as punching, kicking, sitting on the Bobo doll, hitting it with a mallet, and tossing it around the room.

Her difficulty with this also manifested itself in her inability to use word order to tell the difference between sentences such as, \"What is on the blue box?\" and, \"What is the blue box on?\". In addition to the disparity with the results on pronoun and relative clause tests, in which she used word order strategies, researchers wrote this was a major contrast with the clear word order rules in her spontaneous speech. By early 1975 Genie showed comprehension of simple and complex sentences where the object was the relative clause, such as \"The boy is looking at the girl who is frowning\", or sentences where the subject was the relative clause and did not end in a noun phrase, such as \"The boy who is frowning is looking at the girl\". However, when interpreting a complex sentence in which a relative clause ending in a noun phrase came before the main verb, such as \"The boy who is looking at the girl is frowning\", she interpreted the noun closest to the verb as the subject. The scientists wrote that this meant that she was using a word order strategy, which they considered progress because her earlier responses to them were clearly guesses. By this time Genie could only consistently count as high as 7 in sequential order, which came at the expense of her ability to do so via gestalt perception. By 1975 Genie demonstrated full comprehension of several paired words, such as long and short or high and low. Most of the time she learned both words in a pair at the same time, and in a few cases learned either the negative\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Semantic bootstrapping\nContent: or indirect objects. Rondal and Cession suggested that the input evidence assists children to identify those grammatical function categories by using thematic relations (agent, patient, etc.). They found that semantic notions reliably correlate with specific syntactic elements in parental speech and this may support the child’s construction of grammatical categories. Hence, the results of this experiment point to the soundness of the semantic bootstrapping hypothesis. Additional evidence for semantic bootstrapping is illustrated by Gropen et al. and Kim et al. In the experiment done by Gropen et al., children and adults were tested to see whether they could predict a verb’s syntax by using the verb’s meaning. In the experiment, locative verbs were used. Locative verbs link the relationship between a moving object and a location. The moving object is known as the ‘Figure’ and the location is known as the ‘Ground’. For example, in the sentence “Peter poured coffee into the cup.” ‘Pour’ is the locative verb, ‘coffee’ is the ‘Figure’ while ‘cup’ is the ‘Ground’. Children and adults were taught novel verbs for actions that involved the transfer of objects to a container. Then they were tested on whether they were able to express the figure or the ground argument as the direct object of the verb. The major findings of Gropen et al.’s experiments illustrated that both children and adults showed no tendency to express the figure entity as the direct object when faced with a locative verb. Instead, when there is a change of state of the ground object, e.g. The glass (ground object) was filled with water (figure object), children and adults are more likely to select that ground object as the direct object. This shows that children are able to link locative verbs to\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Is the sentence grammatically correct?

The most likely outcome is that Mary the wife of Cleophas (or Clopas) is the same as Mary the mother of James the Less, Simon, Judas (Jude/Thaddeus) and Joses, as well as Clopas' wife.

Papias identifies this \"Mary\" as the sister of Mary, mother of Jesus, and thus as the maternal aunt of Jesus. The Anglican theologian J.B. Lightfoot dismissed Papias' evidence as spurious. The Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, which was probably written in the seventh century, states the brothers of Jesus were his cousins. Roman Catholic and Eastern Christianity maintain that Mary was a perpetual virgin;. early Protestant leaders, including the Reformer Martin Luther,. and Reformed theologian Huldrych Zwingli, also held this view, as did John Wesley, one of the founders of Methodism.. Eine Christliche Lehrtafel (A Christian Catechism), issued by Anabaptist leader Balthasar Hubmaier, teaches the perpetual virginity of the Virgin Mary too. The Catholic Church, following Jerome, conclude that the adelphoi were Jesus' cousins, while Eastern Orthodox Church, following Eusebius and Epiphanius, argue they were Joseph's children from a previous marriage. Anglicans, Lutherans, and Methodists concur with this view. Other Christian denominations, such as Baptists, view the adelphoi as Jesus' half- brothers or do not specify, since the accounts in the Gospels do not speak of Mary's relationship to them but only to Jesus... The term \"half brother\" is used to denote parentage, not genetics. In this view, the other brothers and sisters listed in the Gospel passages would have the same relationship to Jesus. However, some Protestants reject the term \"half brother\" because it is too specific; the Gospel accounts refer to these relatives as brothers and sisters of Jesus, without specifying their parents, and refer to Mary only in relation to Jesus. == Absence of Jesus' brothers == There are some events\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Women at the crucifixion\nContent: mother of Jesus; Mary, the mother of the sons of Zebedee; Salome; a sister of Mary, mother of Jesus; Mary of Clopas.

Jerome also identified James, the brother of Jesus, with the Apostle James, son of Alphaeus (James the less) and thus supposed that Mary of Clopas was married to Alphaeus (Clopas). This view finds support in a fragment found in a medieval manuscript, which lists four Maries mentioned in the gospels and bears the inscription \"Papia\" on the margin. According to Papias, \"Mary the wife of Cleophas or Alphaeus, was the mother of James, Simon and Thaddeus, and of one Joseph.\" The attribution of this fragment to Papias of Hierapolis (ca. 70-163 AD) however has been disputed in favour of a medieval author (possibly Papias the lexicographer, fl. 1040s–1060s) by Anglican bishops and theologians J.B. Lightfoot (1828-1889). and Brooke Foss Westcott (1825–1901). For example Lightfoot argued that it seems quite impossible for Jerome not to quote Papias who would have fully supported his view, despite having access to his writings, and the quote seems to be derived from Jerome's writings, some parts being almost word for word with what Jerome said in adv. Helvid. James Tabor deduced that \"Mary the mother of James and Joses\" is none other than Mary, the mother of Jesus herself. This interpretation would necessitate that Mary the mother of Jesus married a man named Clopas, after her marriage to Joseph (perhaps after his death). Tabor proposes that a brother of Joseph would have been obliged to wed his widowed wife in a Levirate marriage, despite\n\nID: 4\nTitle: James, brother of Jesus\nContent: pp. 69-71 James was called the \"bishop of bishops, who rules Jerusalem, the Holy Church of the Hebrews, and all the Churches everywhere\".Ernest Cushing Richardson and Bernhard Pick, eds.

Scribner's Sons, pp. 218-222 ==Relationship to Jesus, Mary and Joseph== Jesus's brothers James as well as Jude, Simon and Joses are named in Matthew 13:55 and Mark 6:3 and mentioned elsewhere. James's name always appears first in lists, which suggests he was the eldest among them. In Jewish Antiquities (20.9.1), Josephus describes James as \"the brother of Jesus who is called Christ\". Interpretation of the phrase \"brother of the Lord\" and similar phrases is divided between those who believe that Mary had additional children after Jesus (e.g., historian Charles Freeman) and those who hold the perpetual virginity of Mary (Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, and some Protestants, such as many Anglicans and some Lutherans). The only Catholic doctrine which has been defined regarding the \"brothers of the Lord\" is that they are not biological children of Mary; thus, Catholics do not consider them as siblings of Jesus. Near-contemporary sources insist that James was a \"perpetual virgin\" from the womb, a term which according to Robert Eisenman was later converted to his mother, Mary.Eisenman, Robert (2002), James, the Brother of Jesus\" (Watkins) ===Younger half-brother, son of Mary and Joseph=== Some writers, such as R.V.

According to Luke, his parents, Joseph and Mary, took the 12-year-old Jesus to Jerusalem on their annual pilgrimage to the Passover. Mary and Joseph started their journey home without Jesus, thinking he was somewhere in the caravan with kinsmen or acquaintances. When his parents found him three days later, Mary said, \"Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.\" The boy Jesus respectfully but firmly reminded her of a higher claim he must answer: \"Didn't you know I had to be about my Father's business?\" It is noteworthy that in obedience to his parents, Jesus left and was subject to them. ===At the wedding in Cana of Galilee=== ; Mary told Jesus the wine was in short supply. Today his reply may seem curt: \"Woman, what have I to do with you? My hour is not yet come.\" Neither here nor elsewhere does Jesus renounce the mother-son relationship as such, but here, as in , he declares his vocational (ministerial) independence of his mother. He has an \"hour\" to meet, and Mary, though his mother, can neither hasten nor hinder its coming. Most scholars believe that in Jesus' reply to his mother there was no disrespect. According to Matthew Henry's Commentary, he used the same word when speaking to Mary with affection from the cross.Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary http://www.christnotes.org/commentary.php?com=mhc&b;=43&c;=2 Scholar\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Jude, brother of Jesus\nContent: and the implication that Joseph and Mary had customary marital relations thereafter.

Clement of Alexandria who lived c. 150–215 AD wrote in his work \"Comments on the Epistle of Jude\" that Jude, the Epistle of Jude's author was a son of Joseph and a brother of the Lord (without specifying whether he is a son of Joseph by a previous marriage or of Joseph and Mary) According to the surviving fragments of the work Exposition of the Sayings of the Lord of the Apostolic Father Papias of Hierapolis, who lived c. 70–163 AD, Mary the wife of Cleophas or Alphaeus would be the mother of Jude, the brother of Jesus that Papias identifies with Thaddeus: The bishop of Salamis, Epiphanius, wrote in his work The Panarion (AD 374–375) that Joseph became the father of James and his three brothers (Joses, Simeon, Judah) and two sisters (a Salome and a Mary) or (a Salome and an Anna) with James being the elder sibling.

Others, such as K. Beyer, point out that the Greek ('until') after a negative \"often has no implication at all about what happened after the limit of the 'until' was reached\".Raymond E. Brown, The Birth of the Messiah (Doubleday 1999, p. 132 ) Raymond E. Brown also argues that \"the immediate context favors a lack of future implication here, for Matthew is concerned only with stressing Mary's virginity before the child's birth\". In addition, Mary, Joseph, and Jesus's brothers or siblings are often described together, without reference to any other relatives (Matthew 12:46–49, Mark 3:31–34, Mark 6:3, Luke 8:19–21, John 2:12, Acts 1:14), and Jesus's brothers are described without allusion to others (John 7:2–5, 1 Corinthians 9:5. For example, Matthew 13:55–56 says, \"Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary, and aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Jude? Aren't all his sisters with us?\" and John 7:5 says, \"Even his own brothers did not believe in him.\" Clement of Alexandria (), Tertullian (), and Helvidius () were among the theologians who thought that Mary had children other than Jesus.

Its creator, Edgar de Wahl, sought to achieve maximal grammatical regularity and natural character. The vocabulary is based on pre-existing words from various languages and a derivational system which uses recognized prefixes and suffixes. Many of Interlingue's derived word forms reflect those common to certain Western European languages, primarily the Romance languages, along with some Germanic vocabulary. Many of its words are formed using de Wahl's rule, a set of rules for regular conversion of all but six verb infinitives into derived words including from Latin double-stem verbs (e.g. vider to see and its derivative vision). The result is a naturalistic and regular language that is easy to understand at first sight for individuals acquainted with certain Western European languages. Readability and simplified grammar, along with the regular appearance of the magazine Cosmoglotta, made Occidental popular in Europe during the years before World War II despite efforts by the Nazis to suppress international auxiliary languages. Occidental survived the war, but the community had been out of touch with the language's creator since 1939. A Baltic German naval officer and teacher from Estonia, de Wahl refused to leave his Tallinn home for Germany, even after his house was destroyed in the 1943 air raids on the city forcing him to take refuge in a psychiatric hospital. Since most of his mail had been intercepted, he died in 1948 largely unaware of developments in the language. The name change to Interlingue took place the following year for two reasons: (1) to demonstrate to the Soviet Union the language's neutrality, and (2) the expectation of a possible union or closer collaboration\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Interlingue\nContent: (return) step- step- matre (mother) stepmatre (stepmother) -ura -ure scrir (write) scritura (scripture) == Ease of learning == As an international auxiliary language, ease of learning through regular derivation and recognizable vocabulary was a key principle in Occidental's creation. Cosmoglotta often featured letters from new users and former users of other international languages (primarily Esperanto and Ido) attesting to the language's simplicity. New users demonstrated their quick command of the language, and experienced auxiliary language users shared their experiences. Because many users of the language had encountered it after first learning Esperanto, data on learnability of the language for those without experience in other international auxiliary languages is scarce. One experiment to ascertain learning time was carried out in the years 1956 to 1957 in a Swiss Catholic high school (gymnasium) in Disentis on the time required to learn the language. The experiment showed that the students participating in the study, who had previous experience with French, Latin, and Greek, mastered both written and spoken Interlingue after 30 hours of study. Some original texts published as separate books are: * Krasina, raconta del subterrania del Moravian carst, published in 1938 by Jan Amos Kajš. * Li astres del Verne, a collection of original poetry by Jaroslav Podobský, published both in 1935 and 1947. ==Example texts== Translation: \"Material civilization, science, and even art unify themselves more and more.

Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators. :To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words. If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular than that of the individual languages. The new common language will be more simple and regular than the existing European languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental. To an English person, it will seem like simplified English, as a skeptical Cambridge friend of mine told me that Occidental is. ==History and discovery of Li Europan lingues text== The original text of Li Europan lingues comes from an article written in 1933 for the journal Cosmoglotta entitled Occidental es inevitabil (Occidental is inevitable), in which S.W. Beer from the universities of London and Cambridge wrote a letter explaining that he supported the language for practical reasons because he believed it would inevitably become Europe's lingua franca.

One of his articles on this subject was directed toward English and French users who he believed incorrectly saw Occidental as a mix of the two: \"(Occidental's chaotic appearance) is not the fault of Occidental itself, but rather that of its users and especially the French and English, or those that think that the international language should be a mixture of those two languages [...] that is a fundamental error, especially if these forms present exceptions and irregularities in Occidental's system.\" Alphonse Matejka wrote in Cosmoglotta that de Wahl \"always claimed a minimum of autonomy for his language and bitterly fought against all propositions that intended to augment the naturalism of the language only by blindly imitating the Romance languages, or as de Wahl said crudely in one of his letters to me, 'by aping French or English'\". Occidental's erring on the side of regularity led to vocabulary that was still recognizable but different from the international norm, such as ínpossibil in place of impossibil (ín + poss + ibil), scientic (scientific, from scient-ie + -ic), and descrition (description, from descri-r + -tion). This is one of the greatest differences between it and Interlingua, which has a vocabulary taken from so-called 'prototypes' (the most recent common ancestor to its source languages) while Interlingue/Occidental focused on active, spontaneous derivation. Vocabulary was deemed technically permissible even if it did not match forms in other living languages, with these derived words described as \"forms that living languages would have been able to produce using their own means\". === Vocabulary === Though seemingly favourable\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Esperanto vocabulary\nContent: or dealing with specifically Esperantist concerns have arisen over the years. A , for example, is something needlessly incomprehensible, derived from the name of the more complex and less immediately readable constructed language Volapük, which preceded Esperanto by a few years. Words and phrases reflect what speakers of a language talk about. Tellingly, Esperanto has a slang expression (to crocodile) for speaking a language other than Esperanto when Esperanto would be more appropriate, such as at an Esperanto convention, whereas there is nothing equivalent in English. ===Jargon=== Technical jargon exists in Esperanto as it does in English, and this is a major source of debate in the language: whether international jargon should be borrowed into Esperanto, or whether more transparent equivalents should be constructed from existing roots. However, the normal wordplay people use for amusement is occasionally carried to the extreme of being jargon. One such style is called Esperant’, found in chat rooms and occasionally used at Esperanto conventions. (See Esperantido.) ===Artificial variants=== One line of verse, taken from the sole surviving example of the original Lingwe uniwersala of 1878, is used idiomatically: : (it's time). If this stage of Esperanto had been preserved, it would presumably be used to occasionally give a novel the archaic flavor that Latin provides in the modern European languages. Various approaches have been taken to represent deviant language in Esperanto literature. One play, for example, originally written in two dialects of Italian, was translated with Esperanto representing one dialect, and Ido representing the other. Other approaches are to attempt to reconstruct proto-Esperanto, and to create de novo variants of the language. ====Reconstructions==== With so little data available, various attempts have been made to reconstruct\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Comparison between Esperanto and Interlingua\nContent: mal Infinitive suffix -i (invariable) -ar, -er, or -ir Imperative -u suffix same as indicative Plural noun -oj (agglutinative) -s (after vowels) -es (after consonants) Adjectives agree with nouns in number no declension Accusative form mandatory, -n only for personal pronouns No of speakers c. 100,000–2,000,000 c. 1,500 Intelligibility Only with other related constructed languages, i.e. Ido, Esperanto II, Poliespo, etc. Intelligible to speakers of all Romance languages (ca. 1 billion people), and to a lesser extent English == Intellectual background == One cannot ascribe a single outlook to all Esperantists or all Interlinguists; however, the contrasting views of L. L. Zamenhof and Alexander Gode remain influential among Esperantists and Interlinguists, respectively. Zamenhof, the inventor of Esperanto, was motivated by several strands of nineteenth-century idealism, ranging from Comtean positivism to utopian internationalism. Esperanto, in his view, was a theoretically neutral instrument for communication, which could serve as a vehicle for idealistic values, initially Zamenhof's philosophy of homaranismo, later the interna ideo (internal idea) of achieving \"fraternity and justice among all people\" (Zamenhof) through the adoption of Esperanto. Among later Esperantists, this philosophy has tended to reinforce a set of propositions about the language: * Esperanto's European character is purely accidental; however, some features of Esperanto (and of some western languages) can be found in non-Western ones. * Esperanto is, ideally, the universal second language, replacing all other languages in inter-ethnic communication; pro-Esperanto arguments tend to assume a future situation of widespread Esperanto use in many situations where English is currently dominant. * A tension exists between finvenkismo, predicting a 'final victory' (fina venko) of Esperanto, and Raŭmismo, which considers the\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Inflection\nContent: inflected word cars. Words that are never subject to inflection are said to be invariant; for example, the English verb must is an invariant item: it never takes a suffix or changes form to signify a different grammatical category. Its categories can be determined only from its context. Languages that seldom make use of inflection, such as English, are said to be analytic. Analytic languages that do not make use of derivational morphemes, such as Standard Chinese, are said to be isolating. Requiring the forms or inflections of more than one word in a sentence to be compatible with each other according to the rules of the language is known as concord or agreement. For example, in \"the man jumps\", \"man\" is a singular noun, so \"jump\" is constrained in the present tense to use the third person singular suffix \"s\". Languages that have some degree of inflection are synthetic languages. These can be highly inflected (such as Latin, Greek, Biblical Hebrew, and Sanskrit), or slightly inflected (such as English, Dutch, Persian). Languages that are so inflected that a sentence can consist of a single highly inflected word (such as many Native American languages) are called polysynthetic languages. Languages in which each inflection conveys only a single grammatical category, such as Finnish, are known as agglutinative languages, while languages in which a single inflection can convey multiple grammatical roles (such as both nominative case and plural, as in Latin and German) are called fusional. ==Examples in English== In English most nouns are inflected for number with the inflectional plural affix -s (as in \"dog\" → \"dog-s\"), and most English verbs are inflected for tense with the inflectional past tense affix -ed (as in \"call\"\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Interlingue\nContent: where too much of the former may be convenient for the early learner but abhorrent for a speaker, and vice versa: While primarily Romance in vocabulary,Cosmoglotta B, 1945, p. 90 : Translation: \"Occidental being a neo-Latin language, the influence of the languages French, Italian and Spanish will probably still be greater than that of the Anglo-Saxons.\"Cosmoglotta B, 1944, p. 104 : Translation: \"and what else is Occidental than a simplified Italian, or, to state it more generally, the simplified commonality of all Romance languages?\"Cosmoglotta B, 1944, p. 116: Translation: \"Latin is dead, even though it is still used for a few limited purposes. But the mother language Latin still lives in her daughters, the Romance languages—and Occidental is one of them.\" de Wahl opted for a large Germanic substrate which he felt was more expressive for technical and material vocabulary (self, ost (east), svimmar (to swim), moss, etc.), with Romance and Greek vocabulary more appropriate in the derivation of international words (fémina for woman to form feminin, can for dog to form canin (canine), etc.) as well as mental, corporal and natural conceptions. Minor Romance languages such as Ladin, Provençal (Occitan) and Catalan along with creoles were important in the development of Occidental for de Wahl, who wrote as early as 1912 that his language under development was more similar to Provençal than Italian or Spanish. The Swiss magazine Der Landbote made a similar comment while reviewing the language in 1945, commenting humorously that \"reading through the few examples of Occidental gives us the impression of a half-learned Catalan by a foreigner who doesn't much understand the grammar.\" De Wahl stressed that Occidental's natural appearance did not imply wholesale importation of\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Identify the language used in the given sentence: Il est incroyable.\n\n[/INST]IDs: 1, 3, 7</s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

It was the longest recorded economic expansion in the history of the United States until July 2019. == Background == The 1990s were remembered as a time of strong economic growth, steady job creation, low inflation, rising productivity, economic boom, and a surging stock market that resulted from a combination of rapid technological changes and sound central monetary policy. The prosperity of the 1990s was not evenly distributed over the entire decade. The economy was in recession from July 1990 - March 1991, having suffered the S&L; Crisis in 1989, a spike in gas prices as the result of the Gulf War, and the general run of the business cycle since 1983. A surge in inflation in 1988 and 1989 forced the Federal Reserve to raise the discount rate to 8.00% in early 1990, restricting credit into the already-weakening economy. GDP growth and job creation remained weak through late-1992. Unemployment rose from 5.4% in January 1990 to 6.8% in March 1991, and continued to rise until peaking at 7.8% in June 1992. Approximately 1.621 million jobs were shed during the recession. As inflation subsided drastically, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to a then-record low of 3.00% to promote growth. For the first time since the Great Depression, the economy underwent a \"jobless recovery,\" where GDP growth and corporate earnings returned to normal levels while job creation lagged, demonstrating the importance of the financial and service sectors in the national economy, having surpassed the manufacturing sector in the 1980s.\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Economy of the United States\nContent: from the Hoover Dam), military-industrial contracts, and the financial industry. ===Aging=== The U.S. population is aging, which has significant economic implications for GDP growth, productivity, innovation, inequality, and national debt, according to several studies. The average worker in 2019 was aged 42, vs. 38 in 2000. By 2030, about 59% of adults over 16 will be in the labor force, vs. 62% in 2015. One study estimated that aging since 2000 has reduced productivity between 0.25% and 0.7% per year. Since GDP growth is a function of productivity (output per worker) and the number of workers, both trends slow the GDP growth rate. Older workers save more, which pushes interests rates down, offsetting some of the GDP growth reduction but reducing the Federal Reserve's ability to address a recession by lowering interest rates. Means of addressing the aging trend include immigration (which theoretically brings in younger workers) and higher fertility rates, which can be encouraged by incentives to have more children (e.g., tax breaks, subsidies, and more generous paid leave). The Congressional Budget Office estimated in May 2019 that mandatory spending (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security) will continue growing relative to the size of the economy (GDP) as the population ages.

Real GDP per capita increased from $55,790 in 2017 to $57,158 in 2018 to $58,113 in 2019, continuing to set a new record each year (as the U.S. had done since 2010); however real GDP per capita declined to $55,790 in 2020. In 2019, amid concerns about a possible future U.S. recession, caused in part by global uncertainty due to Trump's trade policies, Trump demanded that the Federal Reserve lower interest rates and publicly considering payroll and capital gains tax cuts, as additional stimulus measures, although these were not enacted. Trump claimed in 2017 that GDP growth could reach 6% annually if his tax cuts were passed, a claim that economics identified as highly unrealistic. Throughout his tenure, Trump falsely claimed that the economy under his administration was \"the greatest economy in the history of our country\" and made various inflated and inaccurate claims about the state of the U.S. economy and its rate of growth, including the false claim that GDP had \"doubled and tripled\" under his tenure. Trump repeated some version of the false claim \"The U.S. economy has never been stronger\" some 493 times during his presidency, making it his most-often repeated false claim. ==Infrastructure, inflation, and energy== ===Infrastructure=== Within days of taking office, Trump signed presidential memoranda to revive both the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines; although Trump touted the projects as job- creating measures, the proposed projects were projected to have only a tiny\n\nID: 7\nTitle: 1980s in Japan\nContent: there for work and recreation, rather than a true decentralization. ==Economy== Overall real economic growth was called a \"miracle\", with a 4% average during the 1980s. Throughout the 1970s, Japan had the world's second largest gross national product (GNP)—just behind the United States— and ranked first among major industrial nations in 1990 in per capita GNP at US$23,801, up sharply from US$9,068 in 1980. After a mild economic slump in the mid-1980s, Japan's economy began a period of expansion in 1986 that continued until it again entered a recessionary period in 1992. Economic growth averaging 5% between 1987 and 1989 revived industries, such as steel and construction, which had been relatively dormant in the mid-1980s, and brought record salaries and employment. Unlike the economic booms of the 1960s and 1970s, when increasing exports played the key role in economic expansion, domestic demand propelled the Japanese economy in the late 1980s. This development involved fundamental economic restructuring, moving from dependence on exports to reliance on domestic demand. The boom that started in 1986 was generated by the decisions of companies to increase private plant and equipment spending and of consumers to go on a buying spree. Japan's imports grew at a faster rate than exports. Japanese postwar technological research was carried out for the sake of economic growth rather than military development. The growth in high-technology industries in the 1980s resulted from heightened domestic demand for high-technology products and for higher living, housing, and environmental standards; better health, medical, and welfare opportunities; better leisure-time facilities; and improved ways to accommodate a rapidly aging society.

In the present-day Fahrenheit scale, 0 °F no longer corresponds to the eutectic temperature of ammonium chloride brine as described above. Instead, that eutectic is at approximately 4 °F on the final Fahrenheit scale. The Rankine temperature scale was based upon the Fahrenheit temperature scale, with its zero representing absolute zero instead. ==Usage== ===General=== The Fahrenheit scale was the primary temperature standard for climatic, industrial and medical purposes in English-speaking countries until the 1960s. In the late 1960s and 1970s, the Celsius scale replaced Fahrenheit in almost all of those countries—with the notable exception of the United States and in certain cases, the United Kingdom—typically during their general metrication process. Fahrenheit is used in the United States, its territories and associated states (all served by the U.S. National Weather Service), as well as the Cayman Islands and Liberia for everyday applications. For example, U.S. weather forecasts, food cooking, and freezing temperatures are typically given in degrees Fahrenheit. Scientists, including meteorologists, use degrees Celsius or kelvin in all countries. thumb|upright ===United States=== Early in the 20th century, Halsey and Dale suggested that reasons for resistance to use the centigrade (now Celsius) system in the U.S. included the larger size of each degree Celsius and the lower zero point in the Fahrenheit system; put another way, the Fahrenheit scale is more intuitive than Celsius for describing outdoor temperatures in temperate latitudes, with 100 °F being a hot summer day and 0 °F a cold winter day. ===Canada=== Canada has passed legislation favoring the International System\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Fahrenheit\nContent: A handful of British Overseas Territories, including the Virgin Islands, Montserrat, Anguilla, and Bermuda, still use both scales. All other countries now use Celsius (\"centigrade\" until 1948), a scale formalized about 20 years after the Fahrenheit scale. The United Kingdom started to change from Fahrenheit to Celsius in 1962, and many people remain aware of Fahrenheit temperatures; degrees Fahrenheit are sometimes used in newspaper headlines to sensationalize heatwaves. == Definition and conversion == Historically, on the Fahrenheit scale the freezing point of water was 32 °F, and the boiling point was 212 °F (at standard atmospheric pressure). This put the boiling and freezing points of water 180 degrees apart. Therefore, a degree on the Fahrenheit scale was of the interval between the freezing point and the boiling point. On the Celsius scale, the freezing and boiling points of water were originally defined to be 100 degrees apart. A temperature interval of 1 °F was equal to an interval of degrees Celsius. With the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales now both defined by the kelvin, this relationship was preserved, a temperature interval of 1 °F being equal to an interval of K and of °C. The Fahrenheit and Celsius scales intersect numerically at −40 in the respective unit (i.e, −40 °F ≘ −40 °C). Absolute zero is 0 K, −273.15 °C, or −459.67 °F. The Rankine temperature scale uses degree intervals of the same size as those of the Fahrenheit scale, except that absolute zero is 0 °R the same way that the Kelvin temperature scale matches the Celsius scale, except that absolute zero is 0 K.

Consider the freezing point of water at 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius) and compare it to 96 °F (35.6 °C; normal human body temperature is 37 °C). While 96 is arithmetically three times 32, the difference in temperature from a scientific point of view is not threefold. Instead of comparing 32 to 96, temperatures of 273.15 K and 308.71 K should be compared.Online Conversion – Temperature Conversion The actual scientifically valid change in temperature from 32 to 96 °F is by a factor of 1.13 (308.71/273.15), not 3. If an air cylinder is pressurized to 4,500 psi at 96 °F and later the temperature drops to 32 °F, the pressure gauge will indicate 4,000 psi (4,500/1.13). Stated differently, a drop in temperature of 10 degrees Fahrenheit causes a pressure decrease of about 82 psi. == References == Category:Pressure vessels Category:Firefighter tools\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Fahrenheit\nContent: letter F is the conventional symbol for the Fahrenheit temperature scale. A number followed by this symbol (and separated from it with a space) denotes a specific temperature point (e.g., \"Gallium melts at 85.5763 °F\"). A difference between temperatures or an uncertainty in temperature is also conventionally written the same way as well, e.g., \"The output of the heat exchanger experiences an increase of 72 °F\" or \"Our standard uncertainty is ±5 °F\". However, some authors instead use the notation \"An increase of \" (reversing the symbol order) to indicate temperature differences. Similar conventions exist for the Celsius scale, see . === Conversion (specific temperature point) === For an exact conversion between degrees Fahrenheit and Celsius, and kelvins of a specific temperature point, the following formulas can be applied. Here, is the value in degrees Fahrenheit, the value in degrees Celsius, and the value in kelvins: * °F to °C: = * °C to °F: = × 1.8 + 32 * °F to K: = * K to °F: = × 1.8 − 459.67 There is also an exact conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit scales making use of the correspondence −40 °F ≘ −40 °C. Again, is the numeric value in degrees Fahrenheit, and the numeric value in degrees Celsius: * °F to °C: = − 40 * °C to °F: = ( + 40) × 1.8 − 40 === Conversion (temperature difference or interval) === When converting a temperature interval between the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales, only the ratio is used, without any constant (in this case, the interval has the same numeric value in kelvins as in degrees Celsius): * °F to °C or K: = = * °C or\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Scale of temperature\nContent: VSMOW water under one standard atmosphere of pressure is actually 373.1339 K (99.9839 °C) when adhering strictly to the two-point definition of thermodynamic temperature. When calibrated to ITS–90, where one must interpolate between the defining points of gallium and indium, the boiling point of VSMOW water is about 10 mK less, about 99.974 °C. The virtue of ITS–90 is that another lab in another part of the world will measure the very same temperature with ease due to the advantages of a comprehensive international calibration standard featuring many conveniently spaced, reproducible, defining points spanning a wide range of temperatures. == Celsius scale == Celsius (known until 1948 as centigrade) is a temperature scale that is named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701-1744), who developed a similar temperature scale two years before his death. The degree Celsius (°C) can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale as well as a unit to indicate a temperature interval (a difference between two temperatures). From 1744 until 1954, 0 °C was defined as the freezing point of water and 100 °C was defined as the boiling point of water, both at a pressure of one standard atmosphere. Although these defining correlations are commonly taught in schools today, by international agreement, between 1954 and 2019 the unit degree Celsius and the Celsius scale were defined by absolute zero and the triple point of VSMOW (specially prepared water). This definition also precisely related the Celsius scale to the Kelvin scale, which defines the SI base unit of thermodynamic temperature with symbol K. Absolute zero, the lowest temperature possible, is defined as being exactly 0 K and −273.15 °C.

The lowest temperature was achieved by preparing a frigorific mixture of ice, water, and a salt (\"ammonium chloride or even sea salt\"), and waiting for the eutectic system to reach equilibrium temperature. The thermometer then was placed into the mixture and the liquid in the thermometer allowed to descend to its lowest point. The thermometer's reading there was taken as . The second reference point was selected as the reading of the thermometer when it was placed in still water when ice was just forming on the surface. This was assigned as . The third calibration point, taken as , was selected as the thermometer's reading when the instrument was placed under the arm or in the mouth. Fahrenheit came up with the idea that mercury boils around 300 degrees on this temperature scale. Work by others showed that water boils about 180 degrees above its freezing point. The Fahrenheit scale later was redefined to make the freezing-to-boiling interval exactly 180 degrees, a convenient value as 180 is a highly composite number, meaning that it is evenly divisible into many fractions. It is because of the scale's redefinition that normal mean body temperature today is taken as 98.6 degrees, whereas it was 96 degrees on Fahrenheit's original scale. The Fahrenheit scale was the primary temperature standard for climatic, industrial and medical purposes in English-speaking countries until the 1970s, presently mostly replaced by the Celsius scale long used in the rest of the world, apart from the United States, where temperatures and weather reports are still broadcast in Fahrenheit. ==See also== * Fahrenheit hydrometer * People from Gdańsk (Danzig)\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Kelvin\nContent: to be about 0.6% of standard atmospheric pressure and very close to 0.01 °C per the historical definition of Celsius then in use. In 1948, the Celsius scale was recalibrated by assigning the triple point temperature of water the value of 0.01 °C exactly and allowing the melting point at standard atmospheric pressure to have an empirically determined value (and the actual melting point at ambient pressure to have a fluctuating value) close to 0 °C. This was justified on the grounds that the triple point was judged to give a more accurately reproducible reference temperature than the melting point. In 1954, with absolute zero having been experimentally determined to be about −273.15 °C per the definition of °C then in use, Resolution 3 of the 10th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) introduced a new internationally standardised Kelvin scale which defined the triple point as exactly 273.15 + 0.01 = 273.16 degrees Kelvin. In 1967/1968, Resolution 3 of the 13th CGPM renamed the unit increment of thermodynamic temperature \"kelvin\", symbol K, replacing \"degree Kelvin\", symbol . The 13th CGPM also held in Resolution 4 that \"The kelvin, unit of thermodynamic temperature, is equal to the fraction of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water.\" After the 1983 redefinition of the metre, this left the kelvin, the second, and the kilogram as the only SI units not defined with reference to any other unit.

Languages cross-linguistically differ in their phrase structure rules, resulting in the difference of order of the NP and VP, and other phrases included in a sentence. Languages which do have the similar phrase structure rules, however, will translate so that a sentence from one language will be grammatical when translated into the target language. French example: * Sentence: \"Le chien a aimé la fille\" (translation: \"The dog loved the girl\") The French sentence directly translates to English, demonstrating that the phrase structures of both languages are very similar.thumb|This diagram demonstrates how two phrases combine to form a sentence. In this case, it is both a noun phrase and a verb phrase === Phrase === The idea that words combine to form phrases. For example, the word “the” combines with word “dog” to form the phrase “the dog”. A phrase is a sequence of words or a group of words arranged in a grammatical way to combine and form a sentence. There are five commonly occurring types of phrases; Noun phrases (NP), Adjective phrases (AdjP), Verb phrases (VP), Adverb Phrases (AdvP), and Prepositional Phrases (PP).

However, the exercise revealed that there was no overview or central management to coordinate all participants. As of October 2016, feedback showed that organisations varied in preparedness, with some relying on corporate memory of the 2009 H1N1 response, and others depending on individual pandemic protocols which may be outdated, missing or incomplete. There was also demonstration of silo planning between and within some corporations, however organisations had different levels of detail and structure that could not correspond well when used simultaneously. It was understood that up to half the population will be implicated should there be insufficient understanding of the severity of a pandemic during the response. Exercise Cygnus revealed the need to develop a \"Pandemic Concept of Operations\" to bridge communication between organisations. This aims to manage collective response strategically by delegating specific roles to each organisation and directing their interactions during a pandemic. NHS England recognises that a variety of sectors are implicated, hence a central administration and unified protocol to oversee the whole strategy is required for organisations to work synonymously. Devolved administrations have separate contingency plans which were not investigated during Exercise Cygnus.

The players are also helped by the Event cards, which allow for similar one-time actions, such as direct removal of a few disease cubes or immediate construction of a research station. Pandemic requires all players to coordinate their efforts to win the game, specifically in gathering and sharing the necessary cards to discover cures while moving in coordination around the board and preventing Outbreaks in an efficient manner. However, a criticism of the game, dubbed \"quarterbacking\" is that there is a tendency for one player – the \"alpha gamer\" – to control the game. However, this is not limited to Pandemic – other cooperative board games can also suffer from quarterbacking. ==Expansions== ===On the Brink=== In 2009 the first official expansion was released, featuring several new roles, rules variants for a fifth player, new Special Event cards, and new challenges for the players. There are eight Role Cards in this expansion, including a revised Operation Expert card and a Bio-Terrorist card, which pits one player against the rest of the team. The challenges include a fifth disease, Mutation, which must be cured or not present at the game board when the players score for victory. Another challenge is the Virulent Strain, which makes one disease particularly deadly, replacing standard Epidemic cards with new ones. Each such card represents a special nasty effect that this particular epidemic has on the game play. ===In the Lab=== A second expansion was released in the summer of 2013, with a new game board that allows players to research disease cures in a laboratory.

Time highlighted three possible risks: that preparations for the November 2020 Glasgow conference planned to follow the 2015 Paris Agreement were disrupted; that the public would see global warming as a lower priority issue than the pandemic, weakening the pressure on politicians; and that a desire to \"restart\" the global economy would cause an excess in extra greenhouse gas production. However, the drop in oil prices during the COVID-19 recession could be a good opportunity to get rid of fossil fuel subsidies, according to the executive director of the International Energy Agency. Carbon Tracker argues that China should not stimulate the economy by building planned coal-fired power stations, because many would have negative cashflow and would become stranded assets. The United States' Trump administration suspended the enforcement of some environmental protection laws via the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during the pandemic. This allows polluters to ignore some environmental laws if they can claim that these violations were caused by the pandemic. ==Popular reactions== === Humour === Early in the pandemic, the perceived benefit to the environment caused by a slowdown in human activity led to the creation of memes. These memes generally made light of exaggerated or distorted claims of benefits to the environment, those overly credulous of these claims, and those who compared humanity to COVID, construing human civilization as a viral infection on Earth.

Governments, including those in the United States and France, both prior to the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and during the decade following the pandemic, both strengthened their health care capacities and then weakened them. At the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, health care systems in many countries were functioning near their maximum capacities. In a situation like this, when a sizable new epidemic emerges, a portion of infected and symptomatic patients create an increase in the demand for health care that has only been predicted statistically, without the start date of the epidemic nor the infectivity and lethality known in advance. If the demand surpasses the capacity line in the infections per day curve, then the existing health facilities cannot fully handle the patients, resulting in higher death rates than if preparations had been made. An influential UK study showed that an unmitigated COVID-19 response in the UK could have required up to 46 times the number of available ICU beds. One major public health management challenge is to keep the epidemic wave of incoming patients needing material and human health care resources supplied in a sufficient amount that is considered medically justified. == Flattening the curve == Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as hand washing, social distancing, isolation and disinfection reduce the daily infections, therefore flattening the epidemic curve.

Such words with high precedence numbers are deemed superior to conversational patterns and are treated independently of contextual patterns. Following the first examination, the next step of the process is to apply an appropriate transformation rule, which includes two parts: the \"decomposition rule\" and the \"reassembly rule\". First, the input is reviewed for syntactical patterns in order to establish the minimal context necessary to respond. Using the keywords and other nearby words from the input, different disassembly rules are tested until an appropriate pattern is found. Using the script's rules, the sentence is then \"dismantled\" and arranged into sections of the component parts as the \"decomposition rule for the highest-ranking keyword\" dictates. The example that Weizenbaum gives is the input \"You are very helpful\", which is transformed to \"I are very helpful\". This is then broken into (1) empty (2) \"I\" (3) \"are\" (4) \"very helpful\". The decomposition rule has broken the phrase into four small segments that contain both the keywords and the information in the sentence. The decomposition rule then designates a particular reassembly rule, or set of reassembly rules, to follow when reconstructing the sentence. The reassembly rule takes the fragments of the input that the decomposition rule had created, rearranges them, and adds in programmed words to create a response. Using Weizenbaum's example previously stated, such a reassembly rule would take the fragments and apply them to the phrase \"What makes you think I am (4)\", which would result in \"What makes you think I am very helpful?\". This example is rather simple, since depending upon the disassembly rule, the output could be\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Pandemic predictions and preparations prior to the COVID-19 pandemic\nContent: released its first report in late 2019.

Pandemic: Fall of Rome takes players back in history to the year 395 when Imperial Rome had a weakened army and had left the borders open to invasion from countless tribes. Players must recruit armies, fortify cities, forge alliances, and find peace with their neighbouring peoples consisting of the Anglo-Saxons, Goths, Vandals, and lastly the powerful Huns. It was rebranded as a “Pandemic System Game” from the 2022 edition. === Pandemic: Rapid Response === Pandemic: Rapid Response is a real-time cooperative game set in the Pandemic universe, released in 2019 and designed by Kane Klenko. In Rapid Response, players take on the role of an international crisis response team tasked with delivering essential supplies to cities affected by natural disasters. Players roll dice and allocate the results to various actions, including producing resources, piloting the plane towards affected cities, recycling the waste created by producing resources, and dropping off finished supplies in the cities that need them. The game takes place in real time, with the game briefly pausing and a new city being added after a two-minute timer expires. Players win by delivering relief to all cities and lose by running out of time or creating too much waste. === Pandemic: Hot Zone series === The Hot Zone games are streamlined quicker variants of Pandemic featuring smaller maps of one section of the world, miniature cards, and just three diseases. Each game has different player roles and event cards, and a unique type of challenge cards used to increase difficulty. All of these can be mixed and matched between games in the series. * Pandemic: Hot Zone - North America (July 2020) features “Crisis” challenge cards, negative\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Construct a phrase using the given words Pandemic, challenge, action.\n\n[/INST]IDs: 6, 4, 1, 3</s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

The first restaurant in this chain opened in 1981 in West Los Angeles, specifically in Culver City on Venice Blvd. ==Description== Versailles serves dishes including \"Moors and Christians\" (as black beans with white rice are called), ropa vieja (a stringy beef stew), eastin lechón (suckling pig with sliced onions),LA Times/Frommers as well as beef tongue, sautéed ox tail, halibut in garlic sauce, and roast chicken in Mojo sauce. The restaurant's \"trademark\" is the garlic sauce it serves on its shredded roast pork and chicken. The Lonely Planet guide to California calls it \"Country-style Cuban at its finest\". In a guide to law schools, the Versailles near UCLA is called a favorite and restaurant critic Jonathan Gold wrote in Counter Intelligence that \"everybody but me\" adores the chicken, black beans, avocado salad and other offerings. TheResident Tourist guide calls it a \"Cuban-cuisine dream of a local chain that is good and cheap.\". Best Places Los Angeles describes several of the dishes as very good, and calls the chicken with garlic sauce a must, giving it two stars and noting \"garlic lovers gather at Versailles, where they often wait in line for a table to order the signature Cuban chicken ... at this casual, dark, divish Havanah style restaurant ...\" Meals are commonly served with rice, black beans and fried plantains.

According to Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America, Los Angeles \"remains the United States's preeminent city to eat regional Mexican food.\" The city of Glendale has among the highest concentration of Armenian restaurants in the country. Given its close proximity to Asia and constant flow of Asian immigrants, Asian food has a large foothold in Los Angeles. Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean and Thai restaurants are extremely common place. Japanese food in particular is a staple of Los Angeles' haute cuisine scene with places like Urasawa in Beverly Hills, Nobu in Malibu and Koi in Hollywood. California- styled cuisine is considered to be highly influenced by Asian seafood, as well as by Mediterranean cooking. The popularity of Asian food inspired food festivals such as 626 Night Market in Arcadia, where vendors sell traditional night market foods such as stinky tofu and skewers as well as modern fusion food such as ramen burgers and pho tacos. == Cinema == thumb|190px|TCL Chinese Theatre The greater Los Angeles area is the most important site in the\n\nID: 3\nTitle: List of Michelin starred restaurants in Los Angeles and Southern California\nContent: text: This article contains a complete list of Michelin starred restaurants in Los Angeles and Southern California.

In geometry, calculating the area of a triangle is an elementary problem encountered often in many different situations. The best known and simplest formula is T=bh/2, where b is the length of the base of the triangle, and h is the height or altitude of the triangle. The term \"base\" denotes any side, and \"height\" denotes the length of a perpendicular from the vertex opposite the base onto the line containing the base. In 499 CE Aryabhata, used this illustrated method in the Aryabhatiya (section 2.6).The Āryabhaṭīya by Āryabhaṭa (translated into English by Walter Eugene Clark, 1930) hosted online by the Internet Archive. Although simple, this formula is only useful if the height can be readily found, which is not always the case. For example, the land surveyor of a triangular field might find it relatively easy to measure the length of each side, but relatively difficult to construct a 'height'. Various methods may be used in practice, depending on what is known about the triangle. Other frequently used formulas for the area of a triangle use trigonometry, side lengths (Heron's formula), vectors, coordinates, line integrals, Pick's theorem, or other properties. ==History== Heron (or Hero) of Alexandria found what is known as Heron's formula for the area of a triangle in terms of its sides, and a proof can be found in his book, Metrica, written around 60 CE. It has been suggested that Archimedes knew the formula over two centuries earlier, and since Metrica is a collection of the mathematical knowledge available in the ancient world, it is possible that the formula\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Area\nContent: is the radius of the circular base, and h is the height.

Its altitude is 20 khet. Find its area A in terms of setat. A = 100 \\;\\;\\; setat Problem 52's issues are much the same as those of 51. The method of solution is familiar to moderns, and yet circumstances like those in 51 cast doubt over how well Ahmes or his source understood what they were doing. 53 An isosceles triangle (a tract of land, say) has a base equal to 4 1/2 khet, and an altitude equal to 14 khet. Two line segments parallel to the base further partition the triangle into three sectors, being a bottom trapezoid, a middle trapezoid, and a top (similar) smaller triangle. The line segments cut the triangle's altitude at its midpoint (7) and further at a quarter-point (3 1/2) closer to the base, so that each trapezoid has an altitude of 3 1/2 khet, while the smaller similar triangle has an altitude of 7 khet. Find the lengths l_{1} , l_{2} of the two line segments, where they are the shorter and the longer line segments respectively, and express them in Egyptian fractional terms of khet. Furthermore, find the areas A_{1} , A_{2} , A_{3} of the three sectors, where they are the large trapezoid, the middle trapezoid, and the small triangle respectively, and express them in Egyptian fractional terms of setat and cubit strips.

Eudoxus of Cnidus, also in the 5th century BCE, also found that the area of a disk is proportional to its radius squared. Subsequently, Book I of Euclid's Elements dealt with equality of areas between two-dimensional figures. The mathematician Archimedes used the tools of Euclidean geometry to show that the area inside a circle is equal to that of a right triangle whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius, in his book Measurement of a Circle. (The circumference is 2r, and the area of a triangle is half the base times the height, yielding the area r2 for the disk.) Archimedes approximated the value of π (and hence the area of a unit-radius circle) with his doubling method, in which he inscribed a regular triangle in a circle and noted its area, then doubled the number of sides to give a regular hexagon, then repeatedly doubled the number of sides as the polygon's area got closer and closer to that of the circle (and did the same with circumscribed polygons). ===Triangle area=== ===Quadrilateral area=== In\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Law of sines\nContent: triangle relative to that base is computed as the length of another side times the sine of the angle between the chosen side and the base. Thus depending on the selection of the base, the area of the triangle can be written as any of: T = \\frac{1}{2} b \\left(c \\sin{\\alpha}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} c \\left(a \\sin{\\beta}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} a \\left(b \\sin{\\gamma}\\right). Multiplying these by gives \\frac{2T}{abc} = \\frac{\\sin{\\alpha}}{a} = \\frac{\\sin{\\beta}}{b} = \\frac{\\sin{\\gamma}}{c}\\,. ==The ambiguous case of triangle solution== When using the law of sines to find a side of a triangle, an ambiguous case occurs when two separate triangles can be constructed from the data provided (i.e., there are two different possible solutions to the triangle).

This is because the volume of a cylinder can be obtained in the same way as the volume of a prism with the same height and the same area of the base. Therefore, simply multiply the area of the base by the height: * V = B \\cdot h. Since the area of a circle of radius r\\,, which is the base of the cylinder, is given by B = \\pi r^2 it follows that: * V = \\pi r^2 h or even * V = \\pi r^2 g . == Equilateral cylinder == thumb|Illustration of a cylinder circumscribed by a sphere of radius r. Note that the cylinder is equilateral. The equilateral cylinder is characterized by being a right circular cylinder in which the diameter of the base is equal to the value of the height (geratrix). Then, assuming that the radius of the base of an equilateral cylinder is r\\, then the diameter of the base of this cylinder is 2r\\, and its height is 2r\\,. Its lateral area can be obtained by replacing the height value by 2r: * L = 2 \\pi r \\cdot 2r \\Rightarrow L = 4 \\pi r^2 . The result can be obtained in a similar way for the total area: * T = 2 \\pi r (h + r) \\Rightarrow T = 2 \\pi r (2r + r) \\Rightarrow T = 2 \\pi r \\cdot 3 r \\Rightarrow T = 6 \\pi r^2 . For the equilateral cylinder it is possible to obtain a simpler formula to calculate the volume.

For example, in one game the teams had to tell the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears, with Tim Brooke-Taylor having to fit in the word \"stethoscope\", Graeme Garden \"iPad\", Marcus Brigstocke \"Brazilian\" and Barry Cryer \"porridge\". These words were often shoehorned in regardless of the sentence structure, leading to much laughter from the audience. As is usually the case on I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue, the game is not played seriously. The sentence ending rule is largely ignored, and the end of the sentence is declared almost entirely arbitrarily by Lyttleton sounding his horn.

The game board's base colour is red and the squares of each category are played in turns. ==Special Alias== On the flip side of the New Alias board is the Special Alias version of the board game: the rules are otherwise the same as in New Alias, but the game has different classes: The world around us, Sports and exercise, Entertainment and culture, and Sayings and quotes. The classes Entertainment and culture and Sayings and quotes have special explanations, meaning that the first card contains a hint related to the word, and in the second card, the word to be explained is part of a saying or quote and the word to be explained is replaced, for example, with the word \"beep\". Both classes also contain normal explanations. ==Junior Alias== Junior Alias is otherwise like the normal Alias, except there are also pictures to be explained and the words have been chosen to fit for children. The red colour of the board has been replaced with yellow, and the appearance is more child-friendly. This game is recommended for players over 5 years. ==DVD Alias== The DVD version of Alias is hosted by Marco Bjurström, and as well as word explanations, the game includes exercise. The game takes over an hour. A television and a DVD\n\nID: 2\nTitle: The Jackbox Party Pack\nContent: of words brainstormed by players at the start of the game. During the first two joke rounds, players are given the start of a joke prompt with a missing word they select from a random selection of the brainstormed words. They then finish the joke. Players are then able to perform their joke (either using their own voice or allowing the game to perform), two at a time. The other players and the audience then vote for their favorite of the two. Points are gained by the number of votes between the two players, and a possible \"crushed it\" point bonus is awarded if they get all votes. The final round has players take an existing joke setup and try to write a better joke than the original one. The player with the most points at the end wins. Dictionarium is for 3–8 players and involves players creating a fake dictionary. The game can either be played where the players are given a fake word or a fake slang saying as a prompt. The game is played across three rounds. In the first round, players create a definition and vote for their favorite. Each vote gains points for the player that wrote the definition. In the second round, players create a new word or phrase as a synonym and then vote for their favorite. Each vote gains points for the player that wrote the synonym. In the final round, players create a sentence using the word or phrase and then vote for their favorite. Each vote gains points for the player that wrote the sentence. The player with the most points at the end wins.

The famous example is the meaning of the word \"game\". We speak of various kinds of games: board games, betting games, sports, \"war games\". These are all different uses of the word \"games\". Wittgenstein also gives the example of \"Water!\", which can be used as an exclamation, an order, a request, or an answer to a question. The meaning of the word depends on the language-game within which it is being used. Another way Wittgenstein puts the point is that the word \"water\" has no meaning apart from its use within a language-game. One might use the word as an order to have someone else bring you a glass of water. But it can also be used to warn someone that the water has been poisoned. One might even use the word as code by members of a secret society. Wittgenstein does not limit the application of his concept of language games to word-meaning. He also applies it to sentence-meaning. For example, the sentence \"Moses did not exist\" (§79) can mean various things. Wittgenstein argues that independently of use the sentence does not yet 'say' anything. It is 'meaningless' in the sense of not being significant for a particular purpose. It only acquires significance if we fix it within some context of use. Thus, it fails to say anything because the sentence as such does not yet determine some particular use. The sentence is only meaningful when it is used to say something. For instance, it can be used so as to say that no person or historical figure fits the set of descriptions attributed to the person that goes by the name of \"Moses\". But it can also mean that the leader of the\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Catch Phrase (game)\nContent: vary depending on the size of the group. For instance, larger groups may find that the game moves faster if they play single elimination. Since teams are often passed the device with little time left they are forced to try to guess the phrase as quickly as possible as each point they earn moves them closer to elimination. This adds a frenetic pace to the game (especially when the timer starts ticking fast and you know you only have seconds left) and things can get exciting very quickly. To make things a little easier, each team may be allowed to skip one phrase per turn if they think it is too hard to describe in the time available. Each time the timer runs out, the team left holding the device can change the category if they so desire and must announce the new category to the group before starting the next round. The category cannot be changed once the timer has started. It is considered good sportsmanship for the passing team to skip to the next phrase before passing the device as quickly as possible to the next team, and to start giving clues as soon as possible after receiving the device. If a player waits an unreasonable amount of time (decided by the group as a whole each time an infraction occurs) before passing the device, or before beginning to give clues after receiving the device, that player's team will receive a point and the round ends. The game is similar to Taboo, also from Hasbro, in which a player tries to get his or her teammates to guess words without using the word in question or five related words. ==References== Category:Party games Category:Guessing games Category:Word games\n\nID: 5\nTitle: The Jackbox Party Pack\nContent: all players, and the players except for the artist must enter a phrase they think the picture represents. Then, all those replies, along with the actual phrase for that picture, are presented to the players to make their vote of what they think the original phrase was. The artist of the picture gets points for every other player that guessed their original phrase, while those who wrote other phrases get points for votes their phrase gets. If a player selects a decoy answer, they don't get any points. The player with the most points at the end wins. Word Spud is for 2–8 players and is a word association game. A word is presented and one player, at a time, comes up with a word that is associated with it. The remaining players vote if the association is good or not and the player who came up with the association gets points if it gets the most likes and loses points if it gets the most dislikes. From there, the next player starts from the new word to come up with a new association, and the game continues. The player with the most points at the end wins. Lie Swatter is for 1–100 players and is a multiplayer version of the single-player mobile app that Jackbox Games released prior to The Jackbox Party Pack. The game challenges up to 100 players to correctly guess if presented trivia statements are true or not, \"swatting\" those that are false. Players earn points for correct answers with the fastest player earning additional points. The player with the most points at the end wins.

Players may also combine their own words with additional tiles from the pool in the same way. When a player sees a word, they call it immediately (irrespective of who flipped the last tile) and place the word in front of them. The game then continues with further tiles being flipped. All words must be at least three letters long. When a word is expanded with tiles from the pool, the added tiles may not simply be a suffix (like -S or -ING). The game ends when all tiles are face up and no further words can be formed. Players then score according to the words they have in front of them: a 3-letter word is worth 1 point, a 4-letter word 2 points, and so on. == Variations == A host of variations come from both different versions and players' house rules. ===Scoring=== thumb|If played with Scrabble tiles, the game of Anagrams can use their letter values for scoring Other scoring systems include: *Simple letter count.

The author may distribute copies of their list to family, friends, and other stakeholders who are likely to purchase gifts for the would-be recipient or to offer some of the listed items for sale. The goal of a wish list is to facilitate communication between the gift receiver and the gift giver. Wish lists often contain items that a gift purchaser can obtain from a variety of retailers. Some wish lists are specialized for particular purposes or concentrated at individual retailers, such as gift registries (e.g., bridal registries). ==Occasions== In some cultures, people often exchange wish lists before major holidays that include gift-giving, such as Christmas and birthdays. Other common occasions for issuing wish lists include baby showers, housewarmings, weddings, and charity drives. == Types == * A gift registry is a type of wish list that contains only items that can be purchased at the store which manages the registry. * An online wish list is a type of wish list that is hosted on the Internet. Online wish lists can be associated with a retailer or universal. * A product wish list is similar to a list of functional requirements. The difference is mainly the importance of the requested functionality. Items that might be on the wish list at one time may be expected to be requirements later. * A software user wishlist is a type of wish list that is created by the software manufacturer (such as the software development company or the website owner) or by user groups. * A bucket list is a type of personal wish list consisting of things a person\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Birthday customs and celebrations\nContent: a Happy Birthday\" or \"Happy Birthday\". ==Punches, bumps, spankings, and other birthday torments== \"The bumps\", or \"the dumps\" in Scotland, a birthday torment common in countries such as the UK, Ireland, Canada, and India, involves the friends and family of the person whose birthday it is taking him or her by the arms and legs, and \"bumping\" him/her up into the air and down onto the floor. The number of \"bumps\" given equals the age of the person in years plus one \"for luck\". Usually \"the Bumps\" are administered only to children, in part because as people grow up they become too heavy for the process. Sometimes bumps are also referred to as kicks where the person celebrating their birthday is held by their arms and legs and their friends kick them. This practice is often disapproved in regard to health and safety concerns. In French-speaking Canada, the U.S. and Australia, \"birthday punches\" are given in a similar fashion, with the person whose birthday it is being punched a number of times equal to his/her age, often with one additional punch \"for luck\". In some places, instead of a punch \"for luck\", the recipient is pinched \"to grow an inch\". In Brazil, Hungary, Argentina, Italy, and other countries, the person has his/her earlobes pulled. The Hungarian tradition also involves at the same time as pulling the earlobes wishing the person a happy birthday or reciting a rhyme whose English translation is \"God bless you, live so long so your ears reach your ankles.\". Similar to birthday punches are birthday spankings.

When Abby reaches into a pocket, she finds a birthday present for her—a necklace with a half of a heart saying \"BFF.\" Jay uses the other half as a charm on his key ring. A delivery truck pulls up, and Celeste comes out dressed as a mail woman and gives a package with 16 candles and a matchbox to Abby. Abby lights the first candle, her first wish, meeting celebrity Joey Lockhart, is fulfilled. Abby then realizes that the candles correspond to the wishes on her wish list. Abby lights up the eighth candle and her wish for a red car is fulfilled. Out of the car comes Celeste. Abby realizes Celeste is a magical being and her wishes come true each time a candle is lit, and Celeste appears whenever a wish is granted. Abby unsuccessfully tries to make a third wish. Celeste explains that Abby must wait to make new wishes within new hours, and that, at midnight, Abby's candles expire and the wishes she made will be permanent.

Cooper argues that this indicates: :that the central idea of φιλíα is that of doing well by someone for his own sake, out of concern for him (and not, or not merely, out of concern for oneself). [... Thus] the different forms of φιλíα [as listed above] could be viewed just as different contexts and circumstances in which this kind of mutual well-doing can arise.Cooper, p. 302 Aristotle takes philia to be both necessary as a means to happiness (\"no one would choose to live without friends even if he had all the other goods\" [1155a5-6]) and noble or fine (καλόν) in itself. ==Types== Aristotle divides friendships into three types, based on the motive for forming them: friendships of utility, friendships of pleasure and friendships of the good. Friendships of utility are relationships formed without regard to the other person at all. Buying merchandise, for example, may require meeting another person but usually needs only a very shallow relationship between the buyer and seller. In modern English, people in such a relationship would not even be called friends, but acquaintances (if they even remembered each other afterwards). The only reason these people are communicating is in order to buy or sell things, which is not a bad thing, but as soon as that motivation is gone, so goes the relationship between the two people unless another motivation is found. Complaints and quarrels generally only arise in this type of friendship. At the next level, friendships of pleasure are based on pure delight in the company of other people.

When Buddy and Kim arrive home, Pattie chastises Buddy for their lateness and his drunkenness, which leads to an argument in which both parents end up having to give quarters to the family \"swear jar\". Buddy suggests that if they save up enough in the swear jar, they could go on a road trip, which Pattie quickly shoots down. It is also established that the family is trying to keep secret the fact that they're from Lodi, New Jersey. In her room, Kimberly writes a letter to the Make A Wish Foundation, requesting a treehouse after going back and forth between an array of wishes (\"Make A Wish\"). At school, Martin, Aaron, Delia, and Teresa make plans for a Dreamgirls mashup for their school show choir, one that will compete with their rival West Orange's Evita mashup. They reaffirm their problems with unrequited love (\"Skater Planet (reprise #1)\"). The group then plans on purchasing classic show choir outfits (blue dresses for the girls and turquoise suits for the boys). Kimberly agrees to be Seth's partner for the biology project, and to use her disease as their topic. Delia invites Teresa to Skater Planet, but Teresa wants to invite Martin.

When a 'friendship book' is only one page (no staples), it's called a 'friendship sheet.' If the page is small, like the size of a postcard, or smaller, it's called a 'cram.' Friendship books that have a musical theme, where you have to add lyrics to your entry, are called \"lyrix\" or \"lyrics sheets\". ==Slams== Slams are friendship books that include a theme of questions, either \"Sign if you did/like the following\", \"What is your favorite\" or other similar questions. These usually include one page as a \"sign in\", several pages of questions, and then a \"sign out\" or \"shout out\" page at the end. Slams can be themed or regular. Typically they are small like a standard friendship book. Often they have a \"sign-in\" page where you put your label or name, then each page will often contain a question which you answer (i.e. When was the last time you said \"I love you\") and the signer would write the appropriate response. At the end there is often a sign-out page as well where it's dated. Slams have many variations and can be \"sign if\" slams (you sign only if the statement or question applies to you). These are handled in a number of ways, but most of them become more clear when you have it in-hand. ==Crams== Crams are like friendship sheets or book, but no one includes any personal information.

It occurs after autumn and before spring. The tilt of Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs when a hemisphere is oriented away from the Sun. Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather. When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. In many regions, winter brings snow and freezing temperatures. The moment of winter solstice is when the Sun's elevation with respect to the North or South Pole is at its most negative value; that is, the Sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole. The day on which this occurs has the shortest day and the longest night, with day length increasing and night length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar regions differ from the date of the winter solstice and depend on latitude. They differ due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit (see: earliest and latest sunrise and sunset). ==Etymology== The English word winter comes from the Proto-Germanic noun *wintru-, whose origin is unclear. Several proposals exist, a commonly mentioned one connecting it to the Proto-Indo- European root *wed- 'water' or a nasal infix variant *wend-. ==Cause== The tilt of the Earth's axis relative to its orbital plane plays a large role in the formation of weather. The Earth is tilted at an angle of 23.44° to the plane of its orbit, causing different latitudes to directly face the Sun as the Earth moves through its orbit. This variation\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Winter\nContent: with a below-freezing mean January temperature. ==Meteorological reckoning== thumb|upright=1.3|Animation of snow cover changing with the seasons Meteorological reckoning is the method of measuring the winter season used by meteorologists based on \"sensible weather patterns\" for record keeping purposes, so the start of meteorological winter varies with latitude. Winter is often defined by meteorologists to be the three calendar months with the lowest average temperatures. This corresponds to the months of December, January and February in the Northern Hemisphere, and June, July and August in the Southern Hemisphere. The coldest average temperatures of the season are typically experienced in January or February in the Northern Hemisphere and in June, July or August in the Southern Hemisphere. Nighttime predominates in the winter season, and in some regions winter has the highest rate of precipitation as well as prolonged dampness because of permanent snow cover or high precipitation rates coupled with low temperatures, precluding evaporation. Blizzards often develop and cause many transportation delays. Diamond dust, also known as ice needles or ice crystals, forms at temperatures approaching due to air with slightly higher moisture from above mixing with colder, surface-based air. They are made of simple hexagonal ice crystals. The Swedish meteorological institute (SMHI) defines thermal winter as when the daily mean temperatures are below for five consecutive days. According to the SMHI, winter in Scandinavia is more pronounced when Atlantic low-pressure systems take more southerly and northerly routes, leaving the path open for high-pressure systems to come in and cold temperatures to occur. As a result, the coldest January on record in Stockholm, in 1987, was also the sunniest. Accumulations of snow and ice are commonly associated with winter in the Northern Hemisphere, due to the large land masses there. In the Southern Hemisphere,\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Winter\nContent: to the large land masses there. In the Southern Hemisphere, the more maritime climate and the relative lack of land south of 40°S makes the winters milder; thus, snow and ice are less common in inhabited regions of the Southern Hemisphere. In this region, snow occurs every year in elevated regions such as the Andes, the Great Dividing Range in Australia, and the mountains of New Zealand, and also occurs in the southerly Patagonia region of South Argentina. Snow occurs year- round in Antarctica. ==Astronomical and other calendar-based reckoning== In the Northern Hemisphere, some authorities define the period of winter based on astronomical fixed points (i.e. based solely on the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun), regardless of weather conditions. In one version of this definition, winter begins at the winter solstice and ends at the March equinox. These dates are somewhat later than those used to define the beginning and end of the meteorological winter – usually considered to span the entirety of December, January, and February in the Northern Hemisphere and June, July, and August in the Southern. Astronomically, the winter solstice, being the day of the year which has fewest hours of daylight, ought to be in the middle of the season, but seasonal lag means that the coldest period normally follows the solstice by a few weeks. In some cultures, the season is regarded as beginning at the solstice and ending on the following equinox – in the Northern Hemisphere, depending on the year, this corresponds to the period between 20, 21 or 22 December and 19, 20 or 21 March. In an old Norwegian tradition winter begins on 14 October and ends on the last day of February. In many countries in the Southern\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Winter\nContent: definition, but later than the daylight (Celtic or Chinese) definition. Depending on seasonal lag, this period will vary between climatic regions. Since by almost all definitions valid for the Northern Hemisphere, winter spans 31 December and 1 January, the season is split across years, just like summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Each calendar year includes parts of two winters. This causes ambiguity in associating a winter with a particular year, e.g. \"Winter 2018\". Solutions for this problem include naming both years, e.g. \"Winter 18/19\", or settling on the year the season starts in or on the year most of its days belong to, which is the later year for most definitions. ==Ecological reckoning and activity== Ecological reckoning of winter differs from calendar-based by avoiding the use of fixed dates. It is one of six seasons recognized by most ecologists who customarily use the term hibernal for this period of the year (the other ecological seasons being prevernal, vernal, estival, serotinal, and autumnal). The hibernal season coincides with the main period of biological dormancy each year whose dates vary according to local and regional climates in temperate zones of the Earth. The appearance of flowering plants like the crocus can mark the change from ecological winter to the prevernal season as early as late January in mild temperate climates. To survive the harshness of winter, many animals have developed different behavioral and morphological adaptations for overwintering: *Migration is a common effect of winter upon animals such as migratory birds. Some butterflies also migrate seasonally. *Hibernation is a state of reduced metabolic activity during the winter. Some animals \"sleep\" during winter and only come out when the warm weather returns; e.g., gophers, frogs, snakes, and bats. *Some animals store\n\nID: 4\nTitle: 2017–18 North American winter\nContent: text: The 2017–18 North American winter saw weather patterns across North America that were very active, erratic, and protracted, especially near the end of the season, resulting in widespread snow and cold across the continent during the winter. Significant events included rare snowfall in the South, an outbreak of frigid temperatures that affected the United States during the final week of 2017 and early weeks of January, and a series of strong nor'easters that affected the Northeastern United States during the month of March. In addition, flooding also took place during the month of February in the Central United States. Finally the winter came to a conclusion with a powerful storm system that caused a tornado outbreak and blizzard in mid-April. The most intense event, however, was an extremely powerful cyclonic blizzard that impacted the Northeastern United States in the first week of 2018. Similar to the previous winter, a La Niña was expected to influence the winter weather across North America. While there is no well-agreed-upon date used to indicate the start of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, there are two definitions of winter which may be used. Based on the astronomical definition, winter began at the winter solstice, which in 2017 occurred on December 21, and ends at the March equinox, which in 2018 occurred on March 20. Based on the meteorological definition, the first day of winter is December 1 and the last day February 28. Each definition involves a period of approximately three months, with some variability with both definitions containing two months and a week. Winter is often defined by meteorologists to be the three calendar months with the lowest average temperatures. Since both definitions span the calendar year, it is possible to have a winter storm in two different years. ==\n\nID: 5\nTitle: 2018–19 North American winter\nContent: text: The 2018–19 North American winter was unusually cold within the Northern United States, with frigid temperatures being recorded within the middle of the season. Several notable events occurred, such as a rare snow in the Southeast in December, a strong cold wave and several major winter storms in the Midwest, and upper Northeast and much of Canada in late January and early February, record snowstorms in the Southwest in late February, deadly tornado outbreaks in the Southeast and a historic mid-April blizzard in the Midwest, but the most notable event of the winter was a record-breaking bomb cyclone that affected much of the Central United States and Canada in mid-March. Unlike previous winters, a developing weak El Niño was expected to influence weather patterns across North America. Overall, however, winter of 2018–19 was mild along the mid- and lower parts of the East Coast, the West Coast, and most of the southern Plains. Overall, the meteorological winter of 2018-19 became the wettest on record for the United States.Wettest winter on record for the contiguous United States, National Centers for Environmental Information While there is no well-agreed-upon date used to indicate the start of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, there are two definitions of winter which may be used.

The categories presented below are not used to measure the strength of a storm, but are rather indicators of how severely the snowfall affected the population in the storm's path. Some information such as snowfall amounts or lowest pressure may be unavailable due to a lack of documentation. Winter storms can produce both ice and snow, but are usually more notable in one of these two categories. The \"Maximum accumulation\" sections reflect the more notable category which is represented in inches of snow unless otherwise stated. Only category 1 and higher storms as defined by their regional snowfall index are included here. *Note: A blizzard is defined as having sustained winds of at least 35 mph for three hours or more. ==Seasonal summaries== The following is a table that shows North American winter season summaries dating back to 2009. While there is no well-agreed-upon date used to indicate the start of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, there are two definitions of winter which may be used. The first is astronomical winter, which has the season starting on a date known as the winter solstice, often on or around December 21\\. The season lasts until the spring equinox, which often occurs on or around March 20\\. The second has to do with meteorological winter which varies with latitude for a start date. Winter is often defined by meteorologists to be the three calendar months with the lowest average temperatures.

Despite this, several notable and significant events still occurred, including two separate record-breaking tornado outbreaks in mid-December, a significant winter storm in the South in mid- January, a powerful blizzard that impacted the Northeast coast at the end of January and a wide-ranging, significant winter storm that affected most of the eastern half of the country in early February. Additional significant events included a late-season winter storm in March that affected the Appalachian Mountains, and a major blizzard that affected North and South Dakota in mid- April. Addiitonally, a very late out-of-season snowstorm struck the Rocky Mountains in late May. During the season, four storms have been ranked on the Regional Snowfall Index (RSI), although none attained the “Major” category. Similar to the previous winter, a developing La Niña was expected to influence weather patterns across the continent. Based on the astronomical definition, winter began on the winter solstice on December 21, 2021 and ended on the spring equinox on March 20, 2022. Based on the meteorological definition, the first day of winter started on December 1 and the last day was February 28. These dates historically describe the period in each year when winter storms are most likely to occur. However, winter storms may occur outside of these limits, as shown by the early formation of this season's mid-October winter storm on October 12\\. Since both definitions of winter span the start of the calendar year, it is possible to have a winter storm spanning two different years.

Example: \\begin{align} 3x^2 + 12x + 27 &= 3\\left[x^2+4x\\right] + 27\\\\\\\\[1ex] &{}= 3\\left[(x+2)^2 -4\\right] + 27\\\\\\\\[1ex] &{}= 3(x+2)^2 + 3(-4) + 27\\\\\\\\[1ex] &{}= 3(x+2)^2 - 12 + 27\\\\\\\\[1ex] &{}= 3(x+2)^2 + 15 \\end{align} This allows the writing of any quadratic polynomial in the form a(x-h)^2 + k. ===Formula=== ====Scalar case==== The result of completing the square may be written as a formula. In the general case, one has, Section Formula for the Vertex of a Quadratic Function, page 133–134, figure 2.4.8 ax^2 + bx + c = a(x-h)^2 + k, with h = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad k = c - ah^2 = c - \\frac{b^2}{4a}. In particular, when , one has x^2 + bx + c = (x-h)^2 + k, with h = -\\frac{b}{2} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad k = c - h^2 = c - \\frac{b^2}{4}. By solving the equation a(x-h)^2 + k=0 in terms of x-h, and reorganizing the resulting expression, one gets the quadratic formula for the roots of the quadratic equation: x=\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}. ====Matrix case==== The matrix case looks very similar: x^{\\mathrm{T}}Ax + x^{\\mathrm{T}}b + c = (x - h)^{\\mathrm{T}}A(x - h) + k where h = -\\frac{1}{2}A^{-1}b and k = c - \\frac{1}{4} b^{\\mathrm{T}}A^{-1}b. Note that A has to be symmetric. If A is not symmetric the formulae for h and k have to be generalized to: h = -(A+A^{\\mathrm{T}})^{-1}b \\quad\\text{and}\\quad k = c -\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Elementary algebra\nContent: symbol \"±\" indicates that both : x=\\frac{-b + \\sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad x=\\frac{-b - \\sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a} are solutions of the quadratic equation. Quadratic equations can also be solved using factorization (the reverse process of which is expansion, but for two linear terms is sometimes denoted foiling). As an example of factoring: : x^{2} + 3x - 10 = 0, which is the same thing as : (x + 5)(x - 2) = 0. It follows from the zero-product property that either x = 2 or x = -5 are the solutions, since precisely one of the factors must be equal to zero. All quadratic equations will have two solutions in the complex number system, but need not have any in the real number system. For example, : x^{2} + 1 = 0 has no real number solution since no real number squared equals −1. Sometimes a quadratic equation has a root of multiplicity 2, such as: : (x + 1)^2 = 0. For this equation, −1 is a root of multiplicity 2. This means −1 appears twice, since the equation can be rewritten in factored form as :[x-(-1)][x-(-1)]=0. ====Complex numbers==== All quadratic equations have exactly two solutions in complex numbers (but they may be equal to each other), a category that includes real numbers, imaginary numbers, and sums of real and imaginary numbers. Complex numbers first arise in the teaching of quadratic equations and the quadratic formula. For example, the quadratic equation :x^2+x+1=0 has solutions :x=\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2} \\quad \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\quad x=\\frac{-1-\\sqrt{-3}}{2}. Since \\sqrt{-3} is not any real number, both of these solutions for x are\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Quadratic equation\nContent: algorithm that can be used to solve any quadratic equation.

Calculus for Business and Social Sciences, p. 64 (Richard Dennis Publications, 2001). It can easily be seen, by polynomial expansion, that the following equation is equivalent to the quadratic equation: :\\left(x+\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2=\\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}. Taking the square root of both sides, and isolating , gives: :x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}. Some sources, particularly older ones, use alternative parameterizations of the quadratic equation such as or , where has a magnitude one half of the more common one, possibly with opposite sign. These result in slightly\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Quadratic formula\nContent: Using the equation (\\alpha - \\beta)^2 = (\\alpha + \\beta)^2 - 4\\alpha\\beta yields r_2^2 = p^2 - 4q and thus r_2 = \\pm \\sqrt{p^2 - 4q} If one takes the positive root, breaking symmetry, one obtains: \\begin{align} r_1 &= -p\\\\\\ r_2 &= \\sqrt{p^2 - 4q} \\end{align} and thus \\begin{align} \\alpha &= \\tfrac12\\left(-p+\\sqrt{p^2 - 4q}\\right)\\\\\\ \\beta &= \\tfrac12\\left(-p-\\sqrt{p^2 - 4q}\\right) \\, . \\end{align} Thus the roots are \\tfrac{1}{2} \\left(-p \\pm \\sqrt{p^2 - 4q}\\right) which is the quadratic formula. Substituting yields the usual form for when a quadratic is not monic. The resolvents can be recognized as being the vertex, and is the discriminant (of a monic polynomial). A similar but more complicated method works for cubic equations, where one has three resolvents and a quadratic equation (the \"resolving polynomial\") relating and , which one can solve by the quadratic equation, and similarly for a quartic equation (degree 4), whose resolving polynomial is a cubic, which can in turn be solved. The same method for a quintic equation yields a polynomial of degree 24, which does not simplify the problem, and, in fact, solutions to quintic equations in general cannot be expressed using only roots. ==Historical development== The earliest methods for solving quadratic equations were geometric. Babylonian cuneiform tablets contain problems reducible to solving quadratic equations. The Egyptian Berlin Papyrus, dating back to the Middle Kingdom (2050 BC to 1650 BC), contains the solution to a two-term quadratic equation. The Greek mathematician Euclid (circa 300 BC) used geometric methods to solve quadratic equations in Book 2 of his Elements, an influential mathematical treatise.

This monic polynomial equation has the same solutions as the original. The quadratic formula for the solutions of the reduced quadratic equation, written in terms of its coefficients, is: :x = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( - p \\pm \\sqrt{p^2 - 4q} \\right), or equivalently: :x = - \\frac{p}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{p}{2}\\right)^2 - q}. ===Discriminant=== thumb|right|Figure 3. Discriminant signs|alt=Figure 3. This figure plots three quadratic functions on a single Cartesian plane graph to illustrate the effects of discriminant values. When the discriminant, delta, is positive, the parabola intersects the -axis at two points. When delta is zero, the vertex of the parabola touches the -axis at a single point. When delta is negative, the parabola does not intersect the -axis at all. In the quadratic formula, the expression underneath the square root sign is called the discriminant of the quadratic equation, and is often represented using an upper case or an upper case Greek delta:Δ is the initial of the Greek word Διακρίνουσα, Diakrínousa, discriminant. :\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac. A quadratic equation with real coefficients can have either one or two distinct real roots, or two distinct complex roots. In this case the discriminant determines the number and nature of the roots.

In elementary algebra, the quadratic formula is a formula that provides the solution(s) to a quadratic equation. There are other ways of solving a quadratic equation instead of using the quadratic formula, such as factoring (direct factoring, grouping, AC method), completing the square, graphing and others. Given a general quadratic equation of the form ax^2+bx+c = 0 whose discriminant b^2 - 4ac is positive, with representing an unknown, with , and representing constants, and with , the quadratic formula is: x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} where the plus–minus symbol \"±\" indicates that the quadratic equation has two solutions. Written separately, they become: \\begin{align} x_1 &= \\frac{-b + \\sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\quad\\text{and} \\\\\\ x_2 &= \\frac{-b - \\sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a} \\end{align} Each of these two solutions is also called a root (or zero) of the quadratic equation. Geometrically, these roots represent the -values at which any parabola, explicitly given as , crosses the -axis. As well as being a formula that yields the zeros of any parabola, the quadratic formula can also be used to identify the axis of symmetry of the parabola, and the number of real zeros the quadratic equation contains. The expression is known as the discriminant.

This version of the formula makes it easy to find the roots when using a calculator. When is an even integer, it is usually easier to use the reduced formula x = \\frac{-\\frac{b}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2-ac}}{a} In the case when the discriminant b^2 - 4ac is negative, complex roots are involved. The quadratic formula can be written as: x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\pm i\\sqrt{ \\left | \\left(\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2-\\frac{c}{a} \\right |} \\, . ===Muller's method=== A lesser known quadratic formula, also named \"citardauq\", which is used in Muller's method and which can be found from Vieta's formulas, provides (assuming ) the same roots via the equation: x=\\frac{-2c}{b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}} = \\frac{2c}{-b \\mp \\sqrt {b^2-4ac}} . For positive b, the subtraction causes cancellation in the standard formula (respectively negative b and addition), resulting in poor accuracy. In this case, switching to Muller's formula with the opposite sign is a good workaround. ===Formulations based on alternative parameterizations=== The standard parameterization of the quadratic equation is ax^2 + bx + c=0\\, . Some sources, particularly older ones, use alternative parameterizations of the quadratic equation such as ax^2 - 2b_1 x + c = 0, where b_1 = -b/2, or ax^2 + 2b_2 x +\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Chrystal's equation\nContent: = k where k is an arbitrary constant.

For example, the average of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9 (summing to 25) is 5. Depending on the context, an average might be another statistic such as the median, or mode. For example, the average personal income is often given as the median—the number below which are 50% of personal incomes and above which are 50% of personal incomes—because the mean would be higher by including personal incomes from a few billionaires. For this reason, it is recommended to avoid using the word \"average\" when discussing measures of central tendency. ==General properties== If all numbers in a list are the same number, then their average is also equal to this number. This property is shared by each of the many types of average. Another universal property is monotonicity: if two lists of numbers A and B have the same length, and each entry of list A is at least as large as the corresponding entry on list B, then the average of list A is at least that of list B. Also, all averages satisfy linear homogeneity: if all numbers of a list are multiplied by the same positive number, then its average changes by the same factor. In some types of average, the items in the list are assigned different weights before the average is determined. These include the weighted arithmetic mean, the weighted geometric mean and the weighted median. Also, for some types of moving average, the weight of an item depends on its position in the list. Most types of average, however, satisfy\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Average\nContent: in the list. Most types of average, however, satisfy permutation- insensitivity: all items count equally in determining their average value and their positions in the list are irrelevant; the average of (1, 2, 3, 4, 6) is the same as that of (3, 2, 6, 4, 1). ==Pythagorean means== The arithmetic mean, the geometric mean and the harmonic mean are known collectively as the Pythagorean means. ==Statistical location== The mode, the median, and the mid- range are often used in addition to the mean as estimates of central tendency in descriptive statistics. These can all be seen as minimizing variation by some measure; see . Comparison of common averages of values { 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 } Type Description Example Result Arithmetic mean Sum of values of a data set divided by number of values: \\scriptstyle\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i (1+2+2+3+4+7+9) / 7 4 Median Middle value separating the greater and lesser halves of a data set 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 3 Mode Most frequent value in a data set 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 2 Mid-range The arithmetic mean of the highest and lowest values of a set (1+9) / 2 5 ===Mode=== The most frequently occurring number in a list is called the mode. For example, the mode of the list (1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4) is 3. It may happen that there are two or more numbers which occur equally often and more often than any other number. In this case there is no agreed definition of mode. Some authors say they are all modes and some say there is no mode. ===Median=== The median is the\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Average absolute deviation\nContent: deviation Arithmetic Mean = 5 2 - 5| + |2 - 5| + |3 - 5| + |4 - 5| + |14 - 5|}{5} = 3.6 Median = 3 2 - 3| + |2 - 3| + |3 - 3| + |4 - 3| + |14 - 3|}{5} = 2.8 Mode = 2 2 - 2| + |2 - 2| + |3 - 2| + |4 - 2| + |14 - 2|}{5} = 3.0 === Mean absolute deviation around the mean === The mean absolute deviation (MAD), also referred to as the \"mean deviation\" or sometimes \"average absolute deviation\", is the mean of the data's absolute deviations around the data's mean: the average (absolute) distance from the mean. \"Average absolute deviation\" can refer to either this usage, or to the general form with respect to a specified central point (see above). MAD has been proposed to be used in place of standard deviation since it corresponds better to real life. Because the MAD is a simpler measure of variability than the standard deviation, it can be useful in school teaching. This method's forecast accuracy is very closely related to the mean squared error (MSE) method which is just the average squared error of the forecasts. Although these methods are very closely related, MAD is more commonly used because it is both easier to compute (avoiding the need for squaring) and easier to understand.. For the normal distribution, the ratio of mean absolute deviation from the mean to standard deviation is \\sqrt{2/\\pi} = 0.79788456\\ldots.

For example, in terms of efficiency, given a sample of a normally-distributed numerical parameter, the arithmetic mean (average) for the population can be estimated with maximum efficiency by computing the sample mean – adding all the members of the sample and dividing by the number of members. However, for a large data set (over 100 points) from a symmetric population, the mean can be estimated reasonably efficiently relative to the best estimate by L-estimators. Using a single point, this is done by taking the median of the sample, with no calculations required (other than sorting); this yields an efficiency of 64% or better (for all n). Using two points, a simple estimate is the midhinge (the 25% trimmed mid-range), but a more efficient estimate is the 29% trimmed mid-range, that is, averaging the two values 29% of the way in from the smallest and the largest values: the 29th and 71st percentiles; this has an efficiency of about 81%. For three points, the trimean (average of median and midhinge) can be used, though the average of the 20th, 50th, and 80th percentile yields 88% efficiency. Using further points yield higher efficiency, though it is notable that only 3 points are needed for very high efficiency. For estimating the standard deviation of a normal distribution, the scaled interdecile range gives a reasonably efficient estimator, though instead taking the 7% trimmed range (the difference between the 7th and 93rd percentiles) and dividing by 3 (corresponding to 86% of the data of a normal distribution falling within 1.5 standard deviations of the mean) yields an estimate of about 65% efficiency.

In particular, people noticed that using the square of the average masses yielded much better results: :\\frac{1}{2}\\left[ \\left( \\frac{ K^- + \\bar{K}^0 }{2} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{ K^+ + K^0}{2} \\right)^2\\right] = \\frac{3\\eta^2 + \\pi^2}{4} This now yields :\\frac{1}{2}\\left[ \\left( \\frac{ K^- + \\bar{K}^0 }{2} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{ K^+ + K^0}{2} \\right)^2\\right]= 246\\times10^3~\\mathrm{MeV^2}/c^4 and :\\frac{3\\eta^2 + \\pi^2}{4} = 230\\times10^3~\\mathrm{MeV^2}/c^4 which fall within 5% of each other. For a while, the GMO formula involving the square of masses was simply an empirical relationship; but later a justification for using the square of masses was found in the context of chiral perturbation theory, just for pseudoscalar mesons, since these are the pseudogoldstone bosons of dynamically broken chiral symmetry, and, as such, obey Dashen's mass formula.

Each digit of a number would be stored as the state of a ring counter composed of several triodes. Whether vacuum tubes or thyratrons, the triodes were the most expensive part of a counter. For small radices r less than about 7, a single digit required r triodes. (Larger radices required 2r triodes arranged as r flip-flops, as in ENIAC's decimal counters.) So the number of triodes in a numerical register with n digits was rn. In order to\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Third Vote\nContent: 2/3 1/3 3\\. Extending video surveillance Yes Yes No Yes No No 1/3 2/3 4\\.

However, this method for generating means is not general enough to capture all averages. A more general method for defining an average takes any function g(x1, x2, ..., xn) of a list of arguments that is continuous, strictly increasing in each argument, and symmetric (invariant under permutation of the arguments). The average y is then the value that, when replacing each member of the list, results in the same function value: . This most general definition still captures the important property of all averages that the average of a list of identical elements is that element itself. The function provides the arithmetic mean. The function (where the list elements are positive numbers) provides the geometric mean. The function (where the list elements are positive numbers) provides the harmonic mean. ===Average percentage return and CAGR=== A type of average used in finance is the average percentage return. It is an example of a geometric mean. When the returns are annual, it is called the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). For example, if we are considering a period of two years, and the investment return in the first year is −10% and the return in the second year is +60%, then the average percentage return or CAGR, R, can be obtained by solving the equation: . The value of R that makes this equation true is 0.2, or 20%. This means that the total return over the 2-year period is the same as if there had been 20% growth each year. The order of the years makes no difference – the average percentage returns of +60% and −10% is the same result as that for −10% and +60%. This method can be generalized to examples in\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Find the average of these three numbers: 2, 5, 10 \n\n[/INST]IDs: 1, 0</s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

It turns out to be a disaster; he is so overwhelmed with his troubles that she eventually asks that they just eat in silence, and they part ways not expecting to see one another again. Unsure what to do next, Lisa moves in with Matty, who has a penthouse in the same upscale building where George's father lives. Matty is rich, well-meaning and fun, but is also immature and insensitive, and continues to have casual affairs with other women. George is indicted and could face prison time. Annie is so loyal that she tries to give him inside information in advance, but he urges her not to lose her own job. George and Lisa bump into each other in Matty's building and he offers to help her carry her groceries home. Matty returns home and is upset to find Lisa at “his place” with an uninvited guest. Matty inadvertently offends her, so Lisa moves out and spends a pleasant, tipsy evening at George's modest new apartment. His father then drops one last bombshell on his son: It was he who committed the illegal act for which George is being charged. Due to a previous conviction, Charles would spend at least 25 years--basically, the rest of his life due to his advanced age--in prison, whereas George would only do three years at most. On the night Annie's baby is born and her boyfriend proposes, Lisa begins to reconsider her previous reluctance to settle down. George is clearly smitten with her, but Matty pleads for another chance and she accepts. George makes a proposition to his father: he will take one more shot at persuading Lisa to be with him.

He and Daphne move in together, however they rarely see each other as she spends so much time rehearsing with Joey. Mr McClam calls his son repeatedly, however Harold can't bring himself to answer the phone. At work, Harold and Crabble complain about the state of their lives (\"Eternity\"). The opening night of Joey's play is set for November 9, 1965. On 'Opening Eve', he presents Daphne with a new song (\"I Need More\") which references her acting dreams and her strained relationship with Harold. That night, both Daphne and Harold dream of escaping their empty lives (\"The Rut\"). The next morning, Harold's alarm clock breaks and he sees it as a sign: \"this is what it looks like when time stops!\". He books a train ticket to South Dakota to find Miriam. As he waits for his train, The Narrator talks us through the activities of the other characters: Mr McClam wants to mark the anniversary of his wife's death by seeing La Traviata, but the show is sold out; Daphne and Joey prepare for opening night; and Crabble, alone at the deli, tries to make as many sandwiches as possible (\"At Least I'll Know I Tried\"). Harold is about to board his train when he spots Miriam, who has returned to New York to see Daphne's play. She explains why she can't be with him, but he convinces her to have one lunch with him (\"Me With You\"). This lunch lasts for hours, and as they are about to part ways, the northeast blackout hits and the lights go out.

As the driver takes a ticket from the machine and opens the gate, Bean speeds out of the car park and forces the Reliant to reverse, causing it to topple over. === Act 2: Lunch in the Park === Heading for the park for lunch, Bean greets a man (Angus Deayton) who is also having lunch while sitting on a bench. Spotting him having a sandwich, Bean sets about making his own using ingredients and tools he stuffed into his coat. He cuts two slices of bread from a loaf with scissors, spreads butter on them with his credit card, washes lettuce under a drinking fountain's water before using his sock to spin it dry, kills two sardines he takes out of a jar and then crushes peppercorns folded into a handkerchief using his shoe. After making his sandwich, Bean notices the man sipping some tea, and prepares to make his own using a hot water bottle, putting a teabag into it while placing the bottle's stopper in his ear. He then proceeds to suck up milk from a baby bottle and spit it into the water in the hot water bottle, before sloshing it together. As he prepares to have his lunch, he ties his handkerchief around his neck, opting to use it as a napkin, only for the pepper traces on it to cause him to sneeze, making him drop his sandwich onto the ground and spray his tea all over himself, ruining his own lunch. The man, witnessing this, offers Bean the other half of his pre-packed sandwich as replacement, much to Bean's gratitude as the cap pops out of his ear. === Act 3: The Horror Film === Driving to meet up with his\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Homecoming (Miss Guided)\nContent: with Becky's man.

Later, the preparations for the dance are almost complete, but Tim hasn't asked her. She would advise a female student in this situation to ask him herself, but she'd never do that, because she thinks it would make her look desperate. The next morning, Tim casually rolls into the staff parking lot. Becky, following him, offers to share homemade enchiladas for lunch and talk about the dance. He agrees, but just then Lisa drives into the lot in a classic convertible. Tim admires the car, which promptly breaks down. The scene changes to the nurse fixing Becky's show after she helped Tim push Lisa's disabled palm. Bruce arrives to insist that she use his security detail for the dance, and Becky relents. It's shown in high school that Bruce was the one bullies would bully. Becky's shrieking Tim's name banshee-style down the school hallway at lunchtime. He bails on their enchilada date because he has to study for a parent teacher conference. Becky's eating the enchiladas on her own when Shane comes in.

He also reveals a friend of his asked Lisa out to the dance, but found out Lisa was going with Tim.

Daphne is forced to take a job at a coat and shoe store while attending auditions, none of which are successful. One of these auditions is with the playwright Joey Storms, whose script she describes as 'worse than garbage' after being insulted by the producer. Shortly after this audition, Daphne meets Harold, who is working as a sandwich maker at a deli run by the grumpy Crabble, and he makes her lunch. A few weeks later, he asks her out, and they kiss (\"More Than Just a Friend\"). The Narrator once again disrupts the chronology, taking the audience back in time to show Miriam on the night before she and Daphne leave for New York. Nervous about moving, Miriam finds comfort looking up at the stars, which she associates with her dead father (\"Stars I Trust\"). On Miriam's first night in New York, she has an unsettling encounter with a Romani fortune teller, which reinforces her worries about living in the city. However, she becomes more optimistic when she gets her dream job: waitressing at the Greasy Spoon Café, a 24-hour diner in Brooklyn (\"Breakfast All Day\"). The Narrator takes the audience forward to New Year's Day, 1965, when the playwright Joey Storms enters Daphne's store and declares her his muse (\"What You Do To Me\"). He begs her to star in his new show, entitled 'The Human Condition'. Daphne is ecstatic and goes to the deli to tell Harold her news. He proposes to her and she says yes (\"More Than Just a Friend (Reprise)\"), and decides that Harold and Miriam should meet.

As Nick’s loan falls through, he tells her to rehome her exhibit, so Lucy approaches every gallery she knows. At lunch with Max, he suggests Eva Woolf, who surprisingly offers gallery space. Seemingly about to take it, as she and Max leave together, she has an epiphany. She asks Nadine for help in breaking up with him. He tells her Amelia dumped him, and she concludes that they were not meant to be together, as she’s the hero in his love story, and he’s the villain in hers. She tells Nick, who informs her that now he has a mystery backer providing the finance to complete the venue. They all work to get the opening ready. Lucy opens up to Nick, introducing him to her mom Cheryl, who is in a home due to dementia. Later on, Nick and Lucy are intimate. Then Chloe appears (the cold woman from weeks ago). Lucy leaves, hurt. Finding her, Nick tries to explain that it's over with Chloe, and he only kept Chloe's name on the hotel because changing it would be too expensive. He says he'll stay away from the gallery opening, so as not to distract Lucy from her triumph. Eva Woolf unexpectedly contributes an item to Lucy's exhibition, donating the box of the wedding ring used to fund her own gallery, saying, ‘Pain is inevitable. It’s what you do with it that matters.’ Before the opening, Marco and his wife find Nick, who claims to be ill.

They agree that this is not the way to live, and they will have a conversation about their relationship problems in the evening. They both ask each other for kindness, ask the other for help \"to love you again\" and pray that the wall built up between them can be broken down. They continue to argue until Sam leaves for the office, late for his train. Scene II – Sam, at work, exuding confidence, is dealing with business on the telephone. On the phone, he turns down entreaties from Mr. Partridge, presumably for a loan. The chorus calls him a genius and a \"marvelous man\". Then comes a call from \"Bill\", who he is glad to lend money to: \"You'll return it whenever you want to... Is it sufficient?\" Coincidentally, Bill is also participating in the handball tournament with Sam. The chorus observes that \"When it comes to the giving, no one touches big-hearted Sam\". Scene III – In her analyst's office, Dinah recalls a dream about finding an imaginary garden amid a \"black and bare\" landscape, and sings about the image longingly. Meanwhile, at Sam's office, he asks his secretary if he ever made a pass at her.

He believes that missing lunch may make Rosie less sympathetic towards Pyke. Bertie doubts the plan. As evening approaches, Rosie wants to go home. Bertie drives her and Pyke in the Littles' car. After a while, the car stops. Pyke notices that the car is out of fuel, and insults Bingo for not filling the tank. Rosie defends her husband. Bertie tries to acquire petrol from a nearby house, but the man there is not helpful. Bertie then wanders down the road, and sees his car, driven by Jeeves and containing Bingo. Bingo jumps out, tells Jeeves to wait five minutes, and walks up the road with Bertie, so that they can secretly listen as Rosie and Pyke argue loudly. Then Jeeves drives up, Bingo takes a tin of petrol from the car and hides it nearby, and Bertie and Bingo re-enter the car. They then drive up to Pyke and Rosie. Pyke commands Jeeves to drive her away. Though Rosie is thankful Bingo came, she points out that Bingo should have filled the tank. Bingo says he did, claiming Pyke was mistaken, and that he will fix the car's real problem in a second. Bingo goes to the nearby house and intimidates the man into giving Rosie tea, impressing Rosie.

When implementing a three-way comparison where a three-way comparison operator or method is not already available, it is common to combine two comparisons, such as A = B and A < B, or A < B and A > B. In principle, a compiler might deduce that these two expressions could be replaced by only one comparison followed by multiple tests of the result, but mention of this optimisation is not to be found in texts on the subject. In some cases, three-way comparison can be simulated by subtracting A and B and examining the sign of the result, exploiting special instructions for examining the sign of a number. However, this requires the type of A and B to have a well-defined difference. Fixed-width signed integers may overflow when they are subtracted, floating-point numbers have the value NaN with undefined sign, and character strings have no difference function corresponding to their total order. At the machine level, overflow is typically tracked and can be used to determine order after subtraction, but this information is not usually available to higher-level languages. In one case of a three-way conditional provided by the programming language, Fortran's now-deprecated three-way arithmetic IF statement considers the sign of an arithmetic expression and offers three labels to jump to according to the sign of the result: IF (expression) negative,zero,positive The common library function strcmp in C and related languages is a three-way lexicographic comparison of strings; however, these languages lack a general three-way comparison of other data types. ===Spaceship operator=== The three-way comparison operator for numbers is denoted as `<=>` in Perl, Ruby, Apache\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Classify the following data with three labels: fjsklfjdsklfjsklfjsklfjs\n\n[/INST]IDs: </s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

It is somewhat like being asked, \"how do you do?\" and responding, \"how do you do?\" However, in Soga, the individual being greeted is free to actually delve into the fine details. Additionally, simply drop sir/madam to achieve the same effect as in English. The above dialog only addresses greeting one person because some words change into multiple others e.g. is the combination of a singular prefix ( – 'you'), word ( – 'sleep'), and singular postfix ( – 'how did') spoken as one with a plural form that subsequently becomes , which is composed of two distinct words emerging from two different plural prefixes, a word, and the plural form of the postfix.

Along with Ivanhoe, Kenilworth, and Woodstock this is one of the English novels in the Waverley novels series, with the main action taking place around 1678 in the Peak District, the Isle of Man, and London, and centring on the Popish Plot. ==Plot introduction== Julian Peveril, a Cavalier, is in love with Alice Bridgenorth, a Roundhead's daughter, but both he and his father are accused of involvement with the \"Popish Plot\" of 1678. Most of the story takes place in Derbyshire, London, and on the Isle of Man. The title refers to Peveril Castle in Castleton, Derbyshire. ==Composition and sources== On 25 February 1822 Scott informed his Edinburgh publisher Archibald Constable that he was thinking of writing a novel about the Popish Plot. He seems to have begun composition of Peveril of the Peak immediately after completing The Fortunes of Nigel at the beginning of May and the first volume was complete by mid- July. Thereafter progress slowed, and the second volume was not finished until October: much of Scott's summer was taken up with arranging and superintending George IV's visit to Scotland, and he was deeply distressed at the death of his close friend William Erskine on 14 August. It had been intended that Peveril should be in the normal three volumes, but by mid-October Scott was proposing to extend it to a fourth volume, in the belief that the third volume was turning out better than the first two and that he would hope to sustain this improvement into a fourth. Composition was now up to speed again; indeed, it became frenetic.

Its full extent, at 2,000,000 words, across 7,892 pages, 779 chapters and 27 volumes, means it has been described as one of the longest novels ever written—sometimes the single longest. Men of Good Will and particularly certain portions of it—Encyclopædia Britannica picks out the victory parade at the end of World War I—are emblematic of Romain's philosophy of unanimism, characterised by an interest in the collective rather than individuals. In the preface, Romains says that the ideas behind it can be traced to his very first work, La vie unanime, published in 1904. This emphasis on group spirit is, writes Harry Bergholz, partly why Men of Good Will jumps from character to character as much as it does, rather than following one thread. While characters do recur, their stories may be told discontinuously. Bergholz gives the example of Françoise Mailleul, whose birth is the subject of a chapter in volume 9 but who doesn't feature again, apart from brief reappearances in volumes 13 and 18, until her marriage to Jallez in volume 26. Rather than telling the story of a few people, Romains' aim is \"to paint a complete picture of our twentieth century civilization, in all its aspects, human and inhuman, social as well as psychological\". Plot threads, too, are begun, recursively interrupted, and returned to later, sometimes several volumes on. This cross-volume inter- cutting presses the reader to take the work as a whole, since plots are not always resolved within single volumes, which therefore cannot be fully understood without reference to the others. In all, there are approximately 40 main characters but counts of the full cast vary widely, from 600 total\n\nID: 2\nTitle: The Adventures of Augie March\nContent: if they are not coupled with active pursuit and a clear understanding of one's relationship with others.

The term was coined by John William De Forest in an 1868 essay and later shortened to GAN. De Forest noted that the Great American Novel had most likely not been written yet. Practically, the term refers to a small number of books that have historically been the nexus of discussion, including Moby-Dick (1851), Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), and The Great Gatsby (1925). Exactly what novel or novels warrant the title is without consensus and an assortment have been contended as the idea has evolved and continued into the modern age, with fluctuations in popular and critical regard. William Carlos Williams, Clyde Brion Davis and Philip Roth have written novels about the Great American Novel—titled as such—the latter in the 1970s, a time of prosperity for the concept. Equivalents to and interpretations of the Great American Novel have arisen. Writers and academics have commented upon the term's pragmatics, the different types of novels befitting of title and the idea's relation to race and gender. ==History== === Background and etymology === The development of American literature coincided with the nation's development, especially of its identity.Baym, Nina, ed. The Norton Anthology of American Literature. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 2007. Print. Calls for an \"autonomous national literature\" first appeared during the American Revolution,Buell (2014), p. 25. and, by the mid-18th century, the possibility of American literature exceeding its European counterparts began to take shape, as did that of the Great American Novel, this time being the genesis of novels that would later be considered the Great American Novel.

It has been classified both as a novel cycle and a novel and, at two million words and 7,892 pages, has been cited as one of the longest novels ever written. ==Plot== The volumes, written in chronological order from volume one, Le 6 octobre, through volume twenty-seven, Le 7 octobre, between them cover 6 October 1908 through 7 October 1933 in French life—an average of one volume per year, book-ended by one volume each for two particular days. The plot is expansive and features a large cast of characters, rather than narrowly focusing on individuals, but the two principals are Pierre Jallez, a poet loosely based on Romains, and Jean Jerphanion, a teacher who later goes into politics. They meet in volume 2 starting at the École Normale Supérieure and become friends. Jerphanion marries a woman named Odette and lives happily with her, while Jallez tries several times to find love and is eventually married to Françoise Mailleul. In the course of their careers, meanwhile, Jerphanion spends ten years in the Chamber of Deputies and is briefly Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Jallez finds success as a novelist, each trying to secure peace in their own way, though the First World War takes place halfway through the story, which ends with the first foreshadowings of World War II. ==Structure and themes== Structurally, Men of Good Will is a roman-fleuve—a long work across several volumes with continuation of plot and related characters that may mean it forms a single novel. It has been described as a novel cycle or novel sequence, and as a novel,\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Le Grand Meaulnes\nContent: text: Le Grand Meaulnes () is the only novel by French author Alain-Fournier, who was killed in the first month of World War I. The novel, published in 1913, a year before the author's death, is somewhat autobiographical, especially the name of the heroine Yvonne, for whom he had a doomed infatuation in Paris. Fifteen-year-old François Seurel narrates the story of his friendship with seventeen-year-old Augustin Meaulnes as the latter searches for his lost love. Impulsive, reckless and heroic, Meaulnes embodies the romantic ideal, the search for the unobtainable, and the mysterious world between childhood and adulthood. ==Title== The title is French for \"The Great Meaulnes\". The difficulties in translating the French grand (meaning big, tall, great, etc.) and le domaine perdu (\"lost estate/domain/demesne\") have led to a variety of English titles, including The Wanderer, The Lost Domain, Meaulnes: The Lost Domain, The Wanderer or The End of Youth, Le Grand Meaulnes: The Land of the Lost Contentment, The Lost Estate (Le Grand Meaulnes) and Big Meaulnes (Le Grand Meaulnes). Le Grand Meaulnes inspired the title of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby. \"Fitzgerald borrowed its title for The Great Gatsby (and some critics think Fournier's main characters were models for Nick Carraway, Fitzgerald's narrator, and his lovelorn pal).\" Despite this similarity, French translators of Fitzgerald's novel struggled in the same way to render the word \"great\" and chose Gatsby le magnifique (literally Gatsby the Magnificent). ==Plot summary== François Seurel, the 15-year-old narrator of the book, is the son of M. Seurel, who is the director of the mixed-ages school in a small village in the Sologne, a region of lakes and\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Artamène\nContent: text: Artamène ou le Grand Cyrus (English: ) is a novel sequence, originally published in ten volumes in the 17th century.

This time, we see the main character—Adam Brewster—mature, from childhood and early adolescence, to become a writer like Garp, or Ruth Cole, or Juan Diego, as if writing were an inevitability given the fateful circumstances of his life. And, along the way, despite the darkness, there are points of humor. John's work in progress may ultimately be his funniest novel since The Water-Method Man.\" In an interview with Mike Kilen for The Des Moines Register, published on October 26, 2017, Irving revealed that the title of his new novel-in-progress is Darkness As a Bride. The title comes from lines in Shakespeare's play, Measure for Measure: \"If I must die, / I will encounter darkness as a bride, / and hug it in mine arms.\" He later changed the title to \"The Last Chairlift\". In July 2018, the Dayton Literary Peace Prize announced Irving would be the recipient of the 2018 Richard C.

One could rewrite the functions of \"to be\" as follows: * \"The cat is my only pet\": \"I have only a pet cat\". * \"The cat is Garfield\": \"I call my cat Garfield\". * \"Garfield is a cat\": \"Garfield belongs to the cat species\". * \"A cat is an animal\": \"'Cat' denotes an animal\". * \"The cat is furry\": \"The cat feels furry\" / \"The cat looks furry\" / \"The cat has fur\". * \"The cat is sleeping\": \"The cat sleeps\". * \"The dog is chasing the cat\": \"The dog chases the cat\". * \"There is a cat\": \"I know of a cat\". * \"The cat is on the mat\": \"The cat sits on the mat\". * \"The cat is here\": \"I have the cat with me\". ==Rationale== Bourland and other advocates also suggest that use of E-Prime leads to a less dogmatic style of language that reduces the possibility of misunderstanding or conflict. Kellogg and Bourland describe misuse of the verb to be as creating a \"deity mode of speech\", allowing \"even the most ignorant to transform their opinions magically into god-like pronouncements on the nature of things\". ==Psychological effects== While teaching at the University of Florida, Alfred Korzybski counseled his students to > eliminate the infinitive and verb forms of \"to be\" from their vocabulary, > whereas a second group continued to use \"I am,\" \"You are,\" \"They are\" > statements as usual.

The bird tells the cat, \"Well, I've been sick...\". Disgusted with the tiny creature at first but still desperate, the cat gets a (literal) brainstorm when he sees a bottle of Jumbo Gro plant growth formula on the shelf. Quickly, he pours some of the formula into the bird and sure enough, the canary grows rapidly in size. But before the cat can take a bite, the bird is already over ten feet tall. The canary takes advantage of his new height and beats up on the cat. The cat turns the tables on the bird and drinks the Jumbo Gro formula himself, increasing in size until he is much bigger than the bird. He tosses the formula out of the window only for it to land in the bulldog's mouth. While the now giant-sized cat chases the slightly smaller canary through the side of the house, the bulldog guzzles down the formula. After a quick run around the block, the cat and canary wind up back outside of the house, where a now gigantic bulldog appears before them. The cat runs away in fear as the bulldog tosses the bottle of Jumbo Gro down the chimney, where it rolls out of the fireplace and straight to the mouse, who is reading a book titled “The Lost Squeekend” (a play on the 1944 book The Lost Weekend) in the living room. The dog leaps over the house and chases the cat into the city. Meanwhile, the mouse takes a few sips of the formula, instantly growing to gigantic size. The dog chases the cat through the city, only for the now gargantuan mouse to show up and scare the bulldog away with a simple \"Boo!\".

The fable in the Barlow volume also has two different titles. On the illustration appears the English \"The young man and his cat\", while in the Latin explanatory text it reads De Cata in Fœminam mutate (The cat changed into a woman). Jean de la Fontaine wrote a separate version of this fable, also under the title \"The cat changed into a woman\" (La chatte metamorphosée en femme, II.18), in which he gave the theme of change an extended, thoughtful treatment: ::::So great is stubborn nature's force. ::::In mockery of change, the old ::::Will keep their youthful bent. ::::When once the cloth has got its fold, ::::The smelling-pot its scent, ::::In vain your efforts and your care ::::To make them other than they are. ::::To work reform, do what you will, ::::Old habit will be habit still.Elizur Wright, Fables of La Fontaine, pp.108-10 Though La Fontaine avoided mention of Venus as the intermediary for the change in his fable, she is there in Christopher Pitt's \"The Fable of the Young Man and his Cat\", which is turned into a satirical picture of womanhood. Except in the one important respect, the transformed cat accorded to the 18th-century social norm and ::From a grave thinking Mouser, she was grown ::The gayest Flirt that coach'd it round the Town. Her reversion to cathood is interpreted by Pitt as a return to innate femininity; the foolish man is jilted by her, rather than she being punished by the goddess.Poems and Translations, London 1727, pp.167-171 ==Artistic versions== La\n\nID: 3\nTitle: E-Prime\nContent: be\"== In English, the verb 'to be' (also known as the copula) has several distinct functions: * identity: noun-phrase copula definite-noun ** The cat is my only pet. * class membership: definite-noun copula noun-phrase ** Garfield is a cat. * class inclusion: noun-phrase copula noun-phrase ** A cat is an animal. * predication: noun-phrase copula adjective ** The cat is furry. * ownership: noun-phrase copula possessive-noun ** The cat is theirs. * auxiliary: noun-phrase copula verb-phrase ** The cat is sleeping. with the copula being part of the progressive aspect with the present participle ** The cat is being bitten by the dog. with the copula being part of the passive with the past participle of a transitive verb * existence: medial-proadverb-of-location copula noun-phrase ** There is a cat. * location: noun-phrase copula location-phrase ** The cat is nowhere to be found. Bourland sees specifically the \"identity\" and \"predication\" functions as pernicious but advocates the exclusion of all forms for the sake of simplicity. In the case of the \"existence\" form or the \"location\" form, terms such as exist, sit or lie could substitute for the copula. Some ergative verbs may substitute the copula, including taste, feel, smell, sound, grow, hinge, remain, rest, stay, reside, and turn, among others.Miller, Sally. “SEVENTH AND NINTH GRADE WRITING EXERCISES: Candy, Biographies, and E-Prime.” ETC: A Review of General Semantics, vol. 56, no. 1, 1999, pp. 91–101.

After he briefly transforms into a \"sucker\" (a lollipop), he dejectedly heads over to and spins the Penalty Wheel. He lands on Number 14: \"The Gesundheit\", which he finds out when picking the appropriate file out of a nearby file drawer. He begs not to be punished with Raymond Scott's Powerhouse (section B) music as background, still he is forced to blow bubble gum as the dog shakes \"sneeze powder\" (pepper) on his nose; the resulting huge sneeze causes the bubble gum to completely cover the cat. After the dog says 'Gesundheit', the cat becomes enraged and tries to break free from the gum. The cat refuses to play cards any longer and sits back down on the log. The Gambling Bug speaks into his ear, \"We gotta play percentage. We'll try again,\" and bites the cat's ear again. Excitedly looking to get even, he sits down with the dog once more and, in spite of trying to play smart, instantly loses again. This time the Penalty Wheel lands on Number 75: \"The William Tell\". This entails the dog using a bow to fire, Robin Hood-like, a toilet plunger at an apple on the cat's head. The cat ensures the biggest apple possible is poised so the dog will not miss, but the plunger is aimed, successfully, into the cat's face. The cat pulls the plunger off his face and starts jumping on it in anger. Before biting the ear a third time, the Gambling Bug suggests the cat is due for a winning streak.\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Macedonian language\nContent: indicative, imperative and conditional. The imperative mood can express both a wish or an order to finish a certain action. The imperative only has forms for the second person and is formed using the suffixes -ј (пеј; sing) or -и (оди, walk) for singular and -јте (пејте, sing) or -ете for plural (одете, walk). The first and third subject forms in singular and plural express indirect orders and are conjugated using да or нека and the verb in present tense (да живееме долго, may we live long). In addition to its primary functions, the imperative is used to indicate actions in the past, eternal truths as is the case in sayings and a condition. The Macedonian conditional is conjugated in the same way for all three persons using the particle би and the verbal l-form, би читал (I/you/he would read). ===Syntax=== Macedonian syntax has a subject-verb- object (SVO) word order which is nevertheless flexible and can be topicalized. For instance, the sentence Марија го сака Иван (Marija loves Ivan) can become of the object–verb–subject (OVS) form as well, Иван го сака Марија. Topicalization can also be achieved using a combination of word order and intonation; as an example all of the following sentences give a different point of emphasis: *Мачката ја каса кучето. – The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object) *Кучето мачката ја каса. – The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object) *Мачката кучето ја каса. – The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the subject) *Ја каса кучето мачката. – The dog bites the cat\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Cornish grammar\nContent: sent out tomorrow :The email will be sent out tomorrow. *Y feu kath gwelys y’n lowarth. :VPART was cat seen in.the garden :A cat was seen in the garden.

With other verbs, subject- fronted is the default unmarked word order. This still follows the default verb–subject–object order, since sentences of this kind were in origin relative clauses emphasising the subject: *My a ros lyver da dhe das Jowan de. :me RPART gave book good to father Jowan yesterday :I gave a good book to Jowan's father yesterday. (literally It is me who gave a good book) When the sentence's object is a pronoun, it appears before the verb and after the particle a, although it can also appear after the verb for emphasis: My a’s gwel ‘I see her’, or My a’s gwel hi “I see her”. When auxiliary verbs are used, a possessive pronoun is used with the verbal noun: My a wra hy gweles ‘I see her’ (literally “I do her seeing”), or when stressed, My a wra hy gweles hi “I see her”. In both instances, colloquial spoken Cornish may drop all but the suffixed pronouns, to give My a wel hi and My a wra gweles hi, although this is rarely written. In questions and negative sentences, an interrogative particle and negative particle are used, respectively. These are generally fronted in neutral situations: *A wruss’ta ri an lyver dhodho de? :IPART you.did’you VN.give the book to.him yesterday :Did you give him the book yesterday? *Ny wrug\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Fur language\nContent: úú \"cow\" → kuu \"cows\"; á̱yɨ \"which (one)?\" → ká̱yɨ \"which (ones)?\". *Several syntactic plurals with no singulars, mostly denoting liquids, have k-L-a; kewa \"blood\", koro \"water\", kona \"name, song\" koonà. ===Nouns=== The locative case can be expressed by the suffix -le or by reversing the noun's final tone, e.g.: tòŋ \"house\" → toŋ \"at the house\"; loo \"place\", kàrrà \"far\" → loo kàrrà-le \"at a far place\". The genitive (English possessive s) is expressed by the suffix -iŋ (the i is deleted after a vowel.) If the relationship is possessive, the possessor comes first; otherwise, it comes last; e.g.: nuum \"snake\" → nuumiŋ tàbù \"snake's head\"; jùtà \"forest\" → kàrabà jùtăŋ \"animals of the forest\". ===Pronouns=== Independent subject: Singular Fur Plural Fur I ká we kɨ́ you (sg.) jɨ́ you (pl.) bɨ́ he, she, it yé they yɨeŋ + yeeŋ The object pronouns are identical apart from being low tone and having -ŋó added to the plural forms.

Southern Illinois (especially Cairo, shown on the map) and Southwestern Indiana are sometimes included in this region. Although the region has no formally established boundaries, the designation has been used by various businesses and institutions generally operating in the region. In 1920, journalist C.P.J.

As of the 2020 U.S. census, Washington is the 13th most populous state, with inhabitants, and the 18th largest by land area, spanning of land. Washington is divided into 39 counties and contains 281 municipalities that are divided into cities and towns. Legally, a city in Washington can be described primarily by its class. There are five classes of municipalities in Washington: first class city, second class city, town, unclassified city, and code city. * First class cities are the 10 cities with a population over 10,000 at the time of reorganization and operating under a home rule charter. They are permitted to perform any function specifically granted them by Title 35 RCW (Revised Code of Washington). * Second class cities are the 9 cities with a population over 1,500 at the time of reorganization and operating without a home rule charter. Like first class cities, they are permitted to perform any function specifically granted them by Title 35 RCW. * Towns are the 69 municipalities with a population of under 1,500 at the time of reorganization. Towns are not authorized to operate under a charter. Like the previously listed cities, they are permitted to perform any function specifically granted them by Title 35 RCW. In 1994, the legislature made 1,500 the minimum population required to incorporate. * Unclassified cities are cities that are not operating under any other class. Only one city—Waitsburg, in Walla Walla County—is unclassified. It operates under the 1881 territorial charter under which it was organized, eight years before Washington was admitted to the Union in 1889. * Code cities were created by the state legislature\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Statewide opinion polling for Hillary Clinton for the 2008 United States\npresidential election\nContent: Arizona (10)§ ** Colorado (9) ** Georgia (15)§ ** Idaho (4)§ ** Iowa (7) ** Kansas (6)§ ** Louisiana (9)§ ** Mississippi (6)§ ** Montana (3)§ ** Nebraska (5)§ ** North Carolina (15) ** North Dakota (3)§ ** Oklahoma (7)§ ** South Carolina§ (8) ** South Dakota (3)§ ** Tennessee (11)§ ** Texas (34)§ ** Utah (5)§ ** Virginia (13) ** Wisconsin (10) ** Wyoming (3)§ * Too close to call 1 state (17 electoral votes) ** Michigan (17) Notes: * \"R\" indicates a state where the only current (2008) data is The Rasmussen Reports Balance of Power Calculator * \"§\" indicates a state that is listed as a safe Republican/Democratic state by The Rasmussen Reports Balance of Power Calculator.

Other vernacular regions include the DFW Metroplex, Southern California, the Tri-Cities of Tennessee, the Piedmont Triad, Metrolina and the Research Triangle of North Carolina, the High Desert and Inland Empire in California, the Emerald Coast and the Gold Coast of Florida, and the Twin Cities. ==Research== The World Wide Web is a major source of geographical information submitted by non-specialists. The British Ordnance Survey is sponsoring research at the Universities of Cardiff and Sheffield, the aim of which is to study the use of vernacular geography, and to investigate how information mined from the Web can be used to generate an approximate spatial boundary for an imprecise region. The existing technology for accessing geographical data is not well adapted to the unstructured, largely text-based resources of the Web. Spatial information on the Web can be categorized geographically according to the textual content, but a major problem for GIS developers wanting to use this resource is the vague and imprecise nature of place names that are commonly employed within web documents. In pursuit of delineating vernacular regions, trigger phrases are used by the researchers to capture regular linguistic patterns, which identify relationships between geographic locations. For example, the trigger phrase “X is located in Y” can be \"Birmingham is located in *\" or \"* is located in Birmingham\". The completed trigger phrase is then submitted to a search engine. For each search, up to 100 results are retrieved.

The picture tells you how to arrange the words and the arrangement of the words tells you, or tells me, what's going on in the picture.\" Didion was heavily influenced by Ernest Hemingway, whose writing taught her the importance of how sentences work in a text. Her other influences included George Eliot and Henry James, who wrote \"perfect, indirect, complicated sentences\". Didion was also an observer of journalists, believing the difference between the process of fiction and nonfiction is the element of discovery that takes place in nonfiction, which happens not during the writing, but during the research. Rituals were a part of Didion's creative process. At the end of the day, she would take a break from writing to remove herself from the \"pages\", saying that without the distance, she could not make proper edits.

This way one cannot avoid picking up something of a language—as one can't rest until one has learnt who the murderer is, or whether the girl says yes in the end. (This method was, incidentally, applied successfully even before her, by a Hungarian writer, Dezső Kosztolányi as well: according to his account, he studied Portuguese practically exactly the same way during a holiday of his.) Another keyword of hers was context (she was playfully called Kati Kontext herself): on the one hand, in understanding a text (be it a book or a heard text) the context is relevant, it can help us several times if we don't understand something; on the other hand, she never studied words separately, isolated, but they either remained in her mind based on the text she read or the context she encountered (which is perhaps the best possible way of learning), or she memorized them embedded in phrases (e.g. high wind, keen wind), so if one comes to forget one of them, the other word often used together with it will trigger the former. From adjectival phrases we can even recall the gender in many cases. Kató Lomb recommended using patterns, templates, \"shoemaker's lasts\" or \"cookie-cutters\" elsewhere as well: these are simple, skeletonized sample sentences for a structure or an idiom, elements which can be inserted into the speech like prefabricated slabs (generally in the first person singular), by applying them we can more easily construct even fairly complicated structures.

The book investigated how children develop an understanding of the underlying grammatical structure of their native language, as well as how they use this skill to interpret sentences of increasing complexity as they get older. Despite earlier scientific beliefs that children complete their acquisition of syntax by the age of five, Chomsky's research showed that children continue to develop the skills needed to understand complex constructions beyond that age. As part of her research to understand how children develop the ability to read, she developed a method in the late 1970s called repeated reading, in which children would read a text silently while a recording of the text was played. The child would repeat the process until the text could be read fluently without the tape. Research showed that four readings accompanied by a recording could be enough to provide added reading fluency for most children. More than 100 studies have been performed on the technique, with most finding statistically significant improvements in reading speed and word recognition.Farstrup, Alan E.; and Samuels, S.

According to Hacker, \"It took me a while to convince Bedford of the value of my idea.\" Bedford president Chuck Christensen and co-publisher Joan Feinberg eventually bought the idea and the first edition of A Writer's Reference was published in 1989. A Writer's Reference sold nearly 3 million copies by 2004 and became a staple for college freshmen. It became the best-selling college textbook of any discipline. The book's success allowed Hacker to become a millionaire.

Blunt's ex-husband described himself as \"shell- shocked\" and added that \"a lot of people in this county are disturbed\", while her parents were reluctant to discuss the substance of the memoir. \"Judy sure has a way with words\" is all her mother, Shirley, would say. The author's former father-in-law accused her of fabricating a scene in the opening chapter, which was originally a classroom essay that she wrote in her sophomore year of college. In the chapter she recounted how one day her father-in-law, furious at her for being late at the table for lunch, took her new typewriter outside and \"killed it with a sledgehammer\". Blunt's former in- laws publicly repudiated the account, stating that no such thing had ever happened, and later Blunt admitted that she wrote that as an essay and when trying to fit her life into four pages for the classroom exercise, she wrote \"more of a prose poem\" and the episode was meant to be read symbolically, to represent what she had to endure on her husband's ranch. This particular scene in Blunt's essay is what in 1993 landed her a $100,000 advance for the memoir she had only begun to write, and Ms Desser, her editor, convinced her to make that essay the first chapter in the book, not without considerable objection from the author. Ms Desser commented that the essay \"compresses the essence of her book the same way that an overture contains an entire piece of music,\" adding that she was not aware of the factual\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Bloodchild and Other Stories\nContent: publication. As Butler comments on how solitary and frustrating writing for publication is, she suggests developing a set of specific writing practices: 1. Read every day; 2. Take writing classes and workshops; 3. Write every day; 4. Revise thoroughly; 5. Submit your work for publication even if you get rejected often; 6. \"Persist.\" This last habit, Butler contends, is more important to a writer than talent, inspiration, or even imagination. The Afterword to \"Furor Scribendi\", which Butler translates as \"A Rage for Writing\" or \"Positive Obsession\", reveals that Butler considered persistence as her true \"talent\" or \"habit\" as a writer. == Reception == Reviewers of this short story collection by “the Grande Dame of Science Fiction” were generally impressed by the quality and “its diversity of subject matter.” Janet St. John concluded that “although this book is little 'compact' in size, its ideas are splendidly large” and that “Butler’s imagination is strong --- so is her awareness of how to work real issues subtly into the text of her fiction.”St. John, Janet. \"Bloodchild.\" Booklist 1 Sept. 1995: 47+. The reviewers also discovered, across her stories “whether she is dealing with the role of medical science, biological determinism, the politics of disease, or complex interrelations of race, class, and gender, [that] Butler’s dystopian imagination challenges us to think the worst in complex ways while simultaneously planting utopian seeds of hope.\"Miller, Jim. \"The Technology Fix.\" American Book Review 17.3 (1996): 28.

The predicate provides information about the subject, such as what the subject is, what the subject is doing, or what the subject is like. The relation between a subject and its predicate is sometimes called a nexus. A predicative nominal is a noun phrase, such as in a sentence George III is the king of England, the phrase the king of England being the predicative nominal. In English, the subject and predicative nominal must be connected by a linking verb, also called a copula. A predicative adjective is an adjective, such as in Ivano is attractive, attractive being the predicative adjective. The subject and predicative adjective must also be connected by a copula. === Modern theories of syntax === Some theories of syntax adopt a subject-predicate distinction. For instance, a textbook phrase structure grammar typically divides an English declarative sentence (S) into a noun phrase (NP) and verb phrase (VP). The subject NP is shown in green, and the predicate VP in blue. Languages with more flexible word order (often called nonconfigurational languages) are often treated differently also in phrase structure approaches. :: Predicate tree 1 On the other hand, dependency grammar rejects the binary subject-predicate division and places the finite verb as the root of the sentence.

A survival of its founder’s vigorous method is its invariable roll-call, and it's fine of five cents for absence and ten cents for tardiness”. Katherine C. Pierce, a former Club member, described in her written history of the club: “December 27th, 1879, a vote was passed that ‘if any member appointed to lead the discussion cannot be present, she shall either send a paper or provide a substitute’. At the two hundred and twenty- fifth meeting it was voted ‘that all new members shall take part in one discussion, either actively or by writing a paper, within a year of their admission, or forfeit their membership’.

After each session, members are given homework and are encouraged to complete it before the next session. Each member is given a membership card when they join the club, and the CHW is responsible for signing off the dialogue sessions attended by each member. A certificate of completion is awarded to club members that complete all dialogue sessions. ==Process== The four main CHC stages: === Health Promotion === Members meet weekly for a two-hour session. During these sessions cards are used to engage members in discussions and debates on topics promoting health and hygiene. Various participatory activities take place that entertain and encourage members to get involved in the decision-making process on improving daily hygiene habits. Members are encouraged to make small changes in their own homes each week. These recommended practices rarely require financial expenditure and are solely habit changing. === Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation === Once club members begin to understand the transmission of germs. When a majority of the members become convinced, peer pressure makes sanitation a priority and club members help each other meet their new hygiene standards. Latrines and wells are dug, hand washing facilities are built without outside funds. The maintenance of water facilities is the responsibility of the CHC committee. At the end of this stage, high-risk habits have been replaced by safe hygiene practices and basic safe water and sanitation facilities are available. === Food Agriculture and Nutrition (FAN) === Members focus on child survival and a balanced diet. Communal nutrition gardens are started by CHC members where produce is organised to maintain a balanced year-round diet. These gardens help to support vulnerable families. === Empowerment of Women === CHC meetings can result in the construction of a permanent meeting shelter, which\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Medical Research Club\nContent: meetings are young, active scientists and clinicians in the early years of their independent research careers; 35 new ordinary members have been elected since 2011. Members are encouraged to bring guests, who are invited to join in the discussions. Guests must abide by the rules of the club, under their host’s responsibility. The location is often, but not always, within the research institution in London where the chairman of the meeting works. The meetings are preceded by a social gathering of approximately 30 minutes during which members can introduce their guests to other members. In the meeting proper, the chairman reads the minutes from the previous meeting, then welcomes the members and announces the names of the guests for the evening. Before introducing the speakers, the chairman reads rule 24 to the audience, to remind the speakers of the 15 minute time limit. Three scientific communications are given by the invited speakers, who then become candidates for membership, and the presentation is opened for discussion. The scientific presentations are followed by a dinner in a restaurant, which provides more opportunities for members and guests to interact. === Membership === During the meeting, members and guests are asked to confirm their presence by signing the attendance book. A nomination book is also circulated during the meeting with the name of each candidate for membership on each page. Members only (not guests) have the opportunity to support a candidate by signing the relevant page of the nomination book. At the annual general meeting, which is usually held in November, a motion is made for the candidates who have received 10 nominations to be invited to join the club, and the page with their name is removed from the nomination book. === Types of membership === There are four types of\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Saturday Morning Club\nContent: hundred and forty-second meeting March 7, 1885, members were urged to bring suggestions and criticisms to promote the welfare of the club.

These six members are to constitute a committee, one of the six to be appointed chairman. They are to meet during the month one of more times to prepare the discussion. The papers to be read as formerly, and a general discussion opened.\" Pierce went into great detail regarding how the Constitution of the club was constantly changing to adapt to the welfare of the club, and how closely they adhered to the voted rules. Katherine C. Pierce continued on in her writing, “Growth is essential to prosperity; and we have certainly grown and prospered along the two main lines marked out by our constitution, literary and social. Should the question be asked of any of our Presidents, “what do you consider the most valuable characteristic of the Saturday Morning Club?” I feel sure each one would answer, Its loyalty, or espirit de corps. I wish we had a good Anglo-Saxon word for this essentially Anglo-Saxon virtue. It is a virtue traditional in our club; and to my thinking, it is the best legacy we can leave to future years”. The guidance of the Constitution was crucial to the Club’s success and longevity, according to Pierce and other members. === Performances === Over time, as the Saturday Morning Club’s membership grew steadily, more diverse activities developed. At the January 31, 1874 meeting, Mrs. Howe proposed that the Club offer entertainment, both literary and musical.

Clubhouse is now rolling out Houses, a private space where people can gather away from the larger \"rooms\". Houses are like small clubs. === Events === A lot of conversations in Clubhouse happen spontaneously, but users can schedule conversations by creating events. When scheduling an event, users can first name the event and then set the date and time that the conversation will begin. Users can also add co-hosts to help moderate the event. Once an event is created, it is added to the Clubhouse “bulletin.” The bulletin displays upcoming scheduled events and allows users to set notifications for events by clicking the bell icon corresponding to the event. Users can access the bulletin by clicking on the calendar icon at the top of the home page. === Clubs === At the Clubhouse, clubs are user communities that regularly discuss a common interest. Many clubs are present in Clubhouse representing a wide array of topics and users can find clubs by name under the search tab. A club consists of three categories of users - “Admin”, “Leader\", and “Member”. Members can create private rooms and invite more users into the club.

An admin can modify club settings, add/delete users, change user privileges and create/schedule any type of room. There are three types of clubs - “Open”, “By Approval”, and “Closed” for membership. Any user can join an open club by pressing the\n\nID: 5\nTitle: PlayStation Home\nContent: to 32 members in total, including the owner. A user could only be a member of up to five clubs, including the club that the user may have been the leader of. Though the user could own multiple clubhouse designs, they could only be the leader of one club and decided which clubhouse design would be used as the meeting place for their club. In a similar way to personal spaces, the club's owner was able to set up and decorate a private clubhouse as a meeting point for club members, and the club members could enter the clubhouse at any time. The clubhouses also featured a notice board where the leader or sub-leaders could post messages and announcements to other members. Japan's Basic Clubhouse's video screen had the option to access a Home member's page after they had entered their PSN information. Users could block other users from being a member of their club. In addition to all the standard features of the clubhouses, the War Room Clubhouse helped club owners or sub-leaders get their message across during club meetings or discussions. It also included a special access point allowing users to teleport from the War Room to other set locations. On December 2, 2010, a free exclusive club released for PlayStation Plus subscribers in Europe. The PlayStation Plus Private Members Club was a bar area with several tables and a two-to-four player card game with special rewards. The space also had Plus news, accessed by reviewing a cocktail menu or watching the trailers running on an in-game video screen. On April 11, 2012, a new club called the \"x7 Club\" was released in North America, and could only be accessed by Plus subscribers, or users who had purchased one of the select Home exclusive items.\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Lady Popular\nContent: club. Using the money, the President and Vice President(s) can purchase tomatoes and eggs to help defeat other clubs. They can also use it to increase the club's skills. Gaining more skills makes them more popular, allowing them to do more things. The maximum popularity for each club is 200, maximum members, 50. There is no limit to how many Vice Presidents there can be. Every Lady club has stats that have to be increased by the Club members so they could have a better chance for in-game bonuses and winning club fights. Club fights are team duels organized by the president of the Lady club. The Club president can choose an opponent Lady club and set a date and time for the club fight. All the Club members can join the club fight, thus they have a better chance to win the fight and steal a trophy (if any) from the opponent Lady club for extra bonuses. Each trophy decreases each members' popularity by 10% in fights. If your club is receiving the attack, all members will automatically participate in the club.Posted, New Lady Club option in the game Lady Popular , language: English === Parties === After introducing the Party feature in Lady Popular Fashion Arena, the players can organize their engagement in-game parties and invite other players to them.

Since clubs compete for members, as long as clubs can be closed freely and members are free to exit, prices for clubs will be in line with costs. The free exit option prevents clubs from charging prices that are too high, but incentivizes free- riding. Members understate their benefits, reduce their effort they supply towards achieving the club's collective goals and take advantage of other club members.Todd Sandler (2015) \"Collective Action: fifty years later\", in Springer Link, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11127-015-0252-0. The theory of clubs has been intensively applied to the realm of international alliances. Olson and Zeckhauser (1967) published a cost-sharing analysis of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). In particular they identify the conditions under which it would be in the interest of the club members to increase the size of NATO. According to them every members pay contribution fees, based on their specific marginal values. Therefore, costs shares are computed based on the club's total costs and group size. They point out that the United States is by far the largest contributor to NATO and by that to the collective goal of the institution.

She is good, I am finished\". Note the ambiguity of the Israeli lexical item גמור gamúr: it means both \"complete\" and \"finished\".

The addressee may cancel this presupposition with an answer like \"None of them\". In English, alternative questions are not syntactically distinguished from yes–no questions. Depending on context, the same question may have either interpretation: *Do these muffins have butter or margarine? [I'm on a low fat diet.] *Do these muffins have butter or margarine? [I saw that the recipe said you could use either.] In speech, these are distinguishable by intonation. ===Open questions=== An open question (also called a variable question, non- polar question, or special question) admits indefinitely many possible answers. For example: :Where should we go for lunch? In English, these are typically embodied in a closed interrogative clause, which uses an interrogative word such as when, who, or what. These are also called wh-words, and for this reason open questions may also be called wh-questions. ==Question formation== Questions may be marked by some combination of word order, morphology, interrogative words, and intonation. Where languages have one or more clause type characteristically used to form questions, they are called interrogative clauses. Open and closed questions are generally distinguished grammatically, with the former identified by the use of interrogative words. In English, German, French and various other (mostly European) languages, both forms of interrogative are subject to an inversion of word order between verb and subject. In English, the inversion is limited to auxiliary verbs, which sometimes necessitates the addition of the auxiliary do, as in: ::a. Sam reads the newspaper. ::b. Does Sam read the newspaper? ===Open questions=== Open questions are formed by the use of interrogative words such as, in English, when, what, or which.

Then the 'quiz' would be played. Two celebrity guests – one for each team – would enter the audience to canvas the team's opinions in response to a series of questions posed by Kay. These questions would be on the subject of relationships and would take the form of an 'either/or' choice, i.e. \"What's more important, a big heart or a big wallet?\". The celeb would gather the audience's apparent majority opinion and present this as an answer to Kay. If this answer matched the answer on Kay's card (as gleaned from an earlier general poll) then the team scored a point. The team which scored the most points in the Quiz would be the team represented in the Main Game. The Main Game would see three members of the winning team take part in a final challenge, game or stunt. The three contestants selected to play in the Main Game would be the contestant voted top performer at the pre-show party by the opposite sex, the contestant voted in first place in the Babe or Minger vote, and one other contestant selected randomly from a draw machine. The winner of the final challenge would get to select one of the contenders of the opposite sex to join them for a week in the Boys and Girls apartment in London, where they would be awarded the £100,000 prize money to spend on purchases meeting conditions laid down during the week (e.g. \"Spend £30,000 on items that spell out\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Cornish grammar\nContent: sent out tomorrow :The email will be sent out tomorrow. *Y feu kath gwelys y’n lowarth. :VPART was cat seen in.the garden :A cat was seen in the garden.

This still follows the default verb–subject–object order, since sentences of this kind were in origin relative clauses emphasising the subject: *My a ros lyver da dhe das Jowan de. :me RPART gave book good to father Jowan yesterday :I gave a good book to Jowan's father yesterday. (literally It is me who gave a good book) When the sentence's object is a pronoun, it appears before the verb and after the particle a, although it can also appear after the verb for emphasis: My a’s gwel ‘I see her’, or My a’s gwel hi “I see her”. When auxiliary verbs are used, a possessive pronoun is used with the verbal noun: My a wra hy gweles ‘I see her’ (literally “I do her seeing”), or when stressed, My a wra hy gweles hi “I see her”. In both instances, colloquial spoken Cornish may drop all but the suffixed pronouns, to give My a wel hi and My a wra gweles hi, although this is rarely written. In questions and negative sentences, an interrogative particle and negative particle are used, respectively.

Verbs such as λέγω require either ὡς or ὅτι as an introductory particle. If the introductory verb is in a secondary tense, the finite verb of the ὡς/ὅτι clause is usually changed from the indicative mood into the corresponding tense in the optative mood, but the indicative verb is sometimes retained for vividness. *ἡ γυνή ἐστι καλή. \"The woman is beautiful.\" *ὁ ἀνὴρ ἔλεγεν ὡς ἡ γυνὴ εἴη (present optative) καλή/ἐστι (present indicative) καλή. \"The man said that the woman was beautiful.\" ===Latin=== In Latin grammar, indirect speech is called Allen and Greenough's New Latin Grammar for Schools and Colleges (direct speech is called ōrātiō recta). An indirect statement or question can replace the direct object of a verb that is related to thought or communication. An indirect statement is expressed by changing the case of the subject noun phrase from nominative to accusative and by replacing the main verb with an infinitive (as in the English phrase \"You believe me to be a traitor\" above). The voice remains unchanged, but the tense of the infinitive is controlled mostly by the temporal relationship between the time expressed by the matrix verb's tense and the time denoted by the infinitive. The present tense at the moment of utterance (a simultaneous state of affairs between the matrix verb and the infinitive) is expressed by the present infinitive.

For example, \"James Bond went to an all-night restaurant. When the waitress told him they were out of coffee, he ordered a [blank].\" Because James Bond's signature drink is a martini, shaken, not stirred, the panelists and contestants would be expected to choose that answer.

The word \"economics\" is from the Ancient Greek (, \"family, household, estate\") and (, \"custom, law\"), and hence means \"household management\" or \"management of the state\". An economist is a person using economic concepts and data in the course of employment, or someone who has earned a degree in the subject. The classic brief definition of economics, set out by Lionel Robbins in 1932, is \"the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses\". Without scarcity and alternative uses, there is no economic problem. Briefer yet is \"the study of how people seek to satisfy needs and wants\" and \"the study of the financial aspects of human behavior\". Economics has two broad branches: microeconomics, where the unit of analysis is the individual agent, such as a household or firm, and macroeconomics, where the unit of analysis is an economy as a whole. Another division of the subject distinguishes positive economics, which seeks to predict and explain economic phenomena, from normative economics, which orders choices and actions by some criterion; such orderings necessarily involve subjective value judgments. Since the early part of the 20th century, economics has focused largely on measurable quantities, employing both theoretical models and empirical analysis. Quantitative models, however, can be traced as far back as the physiocratic school. Economic reasoning has been increasingly applied in recent decades to other social situations such as politics, law, psychology, history, religion, marriage and family life, and other social interactions. The expanding domain of economics in the social sciences has been described as economic imperialism.Becker, Gary S. (1976). The Economic Approach\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Economics\nContent: text: Economics () is a social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. Economics focuses on the behaviour and interactions of economic agents and how economies work. Microeconomics analyzes what's viewed as basic elements in the economy, including individual agents and markets, their interactions, and the outcomes of interactions. Individual agents may include, for example, households, firms, buyers, and sellers. Macroeconomics analyzes the economy as a system where production, consumption, saving, and investment interact, and factors affecting it: employment of the resources of labour, capital, and land, currency inflation, economic growth, and public policies that have impact on these elements. Other broad distinctions within economics include those between positive economics, describing \"what is\", and normative economics, advocating \"what ought to be\"; between economic theory and applied economics; between rational and behavioural economics; and between mainstream economics and heterodox economics. Economic analysis can be applied throughout society, including business, finance, cybersecurity, health care, engineering and government. It is also applied to such diverse subjects as crime, education, the family, feminism, law, philosophy, politics, religion, social institutions, war, science, (Note the page is broken in some browsers but is still readable through the source.) and the environment. == Definitions of economics over time == The earlier term for the discipline was 'political economy', but since the late 19th century, it has commonly been called 'economics'. The term is ultimately derived from Ancient Greek (oikonomia) which is a term for the \"way (nomos) to run a household (oikos)\", or in other words the know-how of an (oikonomikos), or \"household or homestead manager\". Derived terms such as \"economy\" can therefore often mean \"frugal\" or \"thrifty\".The terms derive ultimately from ( \"house\")\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Definitions of economics\nContent: text: Various definitions of economics have been proposed, including, \"what economists do\".Attributed to Jacob Viner, per Backhouse, Roger E., and Medema, Steve G. (2009) \"Defining Economics: The Long Road to Acceptance of the Robbins Definition,\" Economica, 76(1) pp. 805–882. The earlier term for 'economics' was political 'economy'. It is adapted from the French Mercantilist usage of économie politique, which extended economy from the ancient Greek term for household management to the national realm as public administration of the affairs of state. Mister James Stuart (1767) wrote the first book in English with 'political economy' in the title, explaining that just as: :Economy in general [is] the art of providing for all the wants of a family, [so the science of political economy] seeks to secure a certain fund of subsistence for all the inhabitants, to obviate every circumstance which may render it precarious; to provide every thing necessary for supplying the wants of the society, and to employ the inhabitants ... in such manner as naturally to create reciprocal relations and dependencies between them, so as to supply one another with reciprocal wants. The title page gave as its subject matter \"population, agriculture, trade, industry, money, coins, interest, circulation, banks, exchange, public credit and taxes\". : J.B. Say (1803), distinguishing the subject from its public-policy uses, defines it as the science of production, distribution, and consumption of wealth.Say, Jean- Baptiste (1803 ). A Treatise on Political Economy; or the Production, Distribution, and Consumption of Wealth, trans. 1834, C. C. Biddle, ed., Grigg and Elliot. On the satirical side, Thomas Carlyle (1849) coined 'the dismal science' as an epithet for classical economics, in this context, commonly linked to the pessimistic analysis of\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Economics\nContent: or \"thrifty\".The terms derive ultimately from ( \"house\") and (, \"custom\" or \"law\"). By extension then, \"political economy\" was the way to manage a polis or state. There are a variety of modern definitions of economics; some reflect evolving views of the subject or different views among economists. Scottish philosopher Adam Smith (1776) defined what was then called political economy as \"an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations\", in particular as: Jean-Baptiste Say (1803), distinguishing the subject matter from its public-policy uses, defined it as the science of production, distribution, and consumption of wealth. On the satirical side, Thomas Carlyle (1849) coined \"the dismal science\" as an epithet for classical economics, in this context, commonly linked to the pessimistic analysis of Malthus (1798). John Stuart Mill (1844) delimited the subject matter further: Alfred Marshall provided a still widely cited definition in his textbook Principles of Economics (1890) that extended analysis beyond wealth and from the societal to the microeconomic level: Lionel Robbins (1932) developed implications of what has been termed \"[p]erhaps the most commonly accepted current definition of the subject\": Robbins described the definition as not classificatory in \"pick[ing] out certain kinds of behaviour\" but rather analytical in \"focus[ing] attention on a particular aspect of behaviour, the form imposed by the influence of scarcity.\" He affirmed that previous economists have usually centred their studies on the analysis of wealth: how wealth is created (production), distributed, and consumed; and how wealth can grow. But he said that economics can be used to study other things, such as war, that are outside its usual focus. This is because war has as the goal winning it (as a sought after end), generates both cost\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Definitions of economics\nContent: that [such] analysis involves.\"Backhouse, Roger E., and Steven Medema (2009). \"Retrospectives: On the Definition of Economics,\" Journal of Economic Perspectives, 23(1), p. 229 [pp. 221–33. John Neville Keynes regarded the discussion leading up to the definition of economics more important than the definition itself.John Neville Keynes, The Scope and Method of Political Economy, p. 51. It would be a way to reveal the scope, direction and troubles the science faces. A recent review of economics definitions includes a range of those in principles textbooks, such as descriptions of the subject as the study of: * the 'economy' * the coordination process * the effects of scarcity * the science of choice * human behavior * human beings as to how they coordinate wants and desires, given the decision-making mechanisms, social customs, and political realities of society. It concludes that the lack of agreement need not affect the subject-matter that the texts treat. Among economists more generally, it argues that a particular definition presented may reflect the direction toward which the author believes economics is evolving, or should evolve.Backhouse, Roger E., and Steven Medema (2009). \"Retrospectives: On the Definition of Economics,\" Journal of Economic Perspectives, 23(1), Introduction and Conclusion [pp. 221–233. ==References== ==Further references== * Bye, Raymond T.

Economy from then on meant national economy as a topic for the economic activities of the citizens of a state. === Industrial Revolution === The first economist in the true modern meaning of the word was the Scotsman Adam Smith (1723–1790) who was inspired partly by the ideas of physiocracy, a reaction to mercantilism and also later Economics student, Adam Mari. He defined the elements of a national economy: products are offered at a natural price generated by the use of competition - supply and demand - and the division of labor. He maintained that the basic motive for free trade is human self-interest. The so-called self-interest hypothesis became the anthropological basis for economics. Thomas Malthus (1766–1834) transferred the idea of supply and demand to the problem of overpopulation. The Industrial Revolution was a period from the 18th to the 19th century where major changes in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and transport had a profound effect on the socioeconomic and cultural conditions starting in the United Kingdom, then subsequently spreading throughout Europe, North America, and eventually the world. The onset of the Industrial Revolution marked a major turning point in human history; almost every aspect of daily life was eventually influenced in some way. In Europe wild capitalism started to replace the system of mercantilism (today: protectionism) and led to economic growth. The period today is called industrial revolution because the system of Production, production and division of labor enabled the mass production of goods. === 20th century === The contemporary concept of \"the economy\" wasn't popularly known until the American Great Depression in the 1930s. After the chaos of two World Wars and the devastating Great Depression, policymakers searched for new ways of controlling the course of the economy.

The fundamental postulate of mathematical economics is that of the rational individual actor – Homo economicus (). In this model, each individual aims solely to accumulate as much profit as possible, and always makes optimal choices using perfect information. This atomistic view of economics allows it to relatively easily mathematize its thinking, because individual calculations are transposed into mathematical calculations. Such mathematical modeling allows one to probe economic mechanisms which would be very difficult to discover by a \"literary\" analysis. For example, explanations of economic cycles are not trivial. Without mathematical modeling, it is hard to go beyond simple statistical observations or unproven speculation. However, many people have rejected or criticized the concept of Homo economicus. Economists note that real people usually have limited information and often make poor choices. Also, as shown in laboratory experiments, people care about fairness and sometimes altruism, not just personal gain. According to critics, mathematization is a veneer that allows for the material's scientific valorization. At the start of the 20th century, there was a movement to express historical movements in formulas. In 1922, Nikolai Kondratiev discerned the ~50-year-long Kondratiev cycle, which explains phases of economic growth or crisis. Towards the end of the 19th century, and had extended their analysis into geopolitics. They wanted to establish the historical existence of vast movements that took peoples to their apogee, then to their decline.Dictionnaire en économie et science sociale, Ed.Nathan Paris, dictionnaire Larousse en 3. vol, Paris.

The multiple choice format is most frequently used in educational testing, in market research, and in elections, when a person chooses between multiple candidates, parties, or policies. Although E. L. Thorndike developed an early scientific approach to testing students, it was his assistant Benjamin D. Wood who developed the multiple-choice test. Multiple-choice testing increased in popularity in the mid-20th century when scanners and data-processing machines were developed to check the result. Christopher P. Sole created the first multiple-choice examination for computers on a Sharp Mz 80 computer in 1982. It was developed to aid people with dyslexia cope with agricultural subjects, as Latin plant names can be difficult to understand and write. == Structure == Multiple choice items consist of a stem and several alternative answers. The stem is the opening—a problem to be solved, a question asked, or an incomplete statement to be completed. The options are the possible answers that the examinee can choose from, with the correct answer called the key and the incorrect answers called distractors. Only one answer may be keyed as correct. This contrasts with multiple response items in which more than one answer may be keyed as correct. Usually, a correct answer earns a set number of points toward the total mark, and an incorrect answer earns nothing. However, tests may also award partial credit for unanswered questions or penalize students for incorrect answers, to discourage guessing. For example, the SAT Subject tests remove a quarter point from\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Graduate Management Admission Test\nContent: tests ability to analyze information and draw a conclusion. Reading comprehension passages can be anywhere from one to several paragraphs long. According to GMAC, the critical reasoning question type assesses reasoning skills. According to GMAC, the sentence correction question type tests grammar and effective communication skills. From the available answer options, the test taker should select the most effective construction that best expresses the intent of the sentence. ==Scoring== The total GMAT score ranges from 200 to 800 and measures performance on the quantitative and verbal sections together (performance on the AWA and IR sections do not count toward the total score, those sections are scored separately). Scores are given in increments of 10 (e.g. 540, 550, 560, 570, etc.). The score distribution conforms to a bell curve with a standard deviation of approximately 120 points, meaning that about 68% of examinees score between 430 and 670. More precisely, over the three-year period 2014–2017 the mean score was 556.04 with a standard deviation of 120.45 points. The final score is not based solely on the last question the examinee answers (i.e. the level of difficulty of questions reached through the computer adaptive presentation of questions). The algorithm used to build a score is more complicated than that. The examinee can make a mistake and answer incorrectly and the computer will recognize that item as an anomaly. If the examinee misses the first question, the final score will not necessarily fall in the bottom half of the range. At the end of the exam, an unofficial preview of the GMAT score earned is shown to the test taker, who then has two minutes to decide whether to keep or cancel the score at the test center. A test taker can also cancel a score\n\nID: 4\nTitle: USPTO registration examination\nContent: time. == Structure == The exam is a 100-question, six-hour, multiple- choice test. The test is divided into morning and afternoon sections, each comprising fifty questions completed within a three-hour time limit. The exam contains 10 beta questions which do not count towards the exam taker's final score, but they are not identified among the hundred. The required score to pass is 70%, or 63 correct out of the 90 graded questions. Over the past decade and a half, pass rates for the examination have ranged from 42.8% (2014) to 59.6% (2009). Before June 2004, the USPTO registration exam was a pencil-and-paper test given at approximately 15 locations around the country. The USPTO has moved to a computer-based examination which can be taken on any business day at any of several hundred Prometric locations around the country. A sample computerized exam is available to provide a feel for how the exam is administered, but this \"practice exam\" contains no sample questions. Once an applicant has been approved to sit for the exam, he or she has 90 days in which to schedule an examination date with Prometric. Past exams from 2002 and 2003 are available from the USPTO online without cost. == Prerequisites == === General === The USPTO requires that all those applying for registration (agents or attorneys) meet three requirements: (1) good moral character, (2) legal, scientific and technical qualifications necessary to render valuable service, and (3) competence to advise and assist patent applicants in the presentation and prosecution of patent applications. The registration exam primarily addresses the third requirement. The second requirement is typically met with a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree in a recognized technical subject; the USPTO calls this \"Category A\" eligibility.\n\nID: 5\nTitle: National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (Postgraduate)\nContent: examination is computer based, consisting of 200 mcqs multiple choice questions (MCQ) with single response.

It became notorious for answer key leakage, cheating, fraud, and corruption. Some argue that the exam is too demanding for students. Schools were forced to allocate more time for preparing the students, putting a significant workload on both teachers and students. The National Exam failure rate is usually very low. Critics argue that it does not give an accurate portrayal of the Indonesian students' real competency because of problems with cheating and other issues. The 2010 National Exam fail rate for middle and high school was unusually high. A possible explanation for this sudden increase in failure rate is due to the fact that the test was to be issued in March, giving schools less time for prepare. Additionally, there was an increase in the difficulty of questions and the cutoff score was raised. There were National Exam retests held in 2009 and 2010, but any further retests were discontinued the following year. Some Indonesians call for the abolishment of the National Exam. However, the Education and Culture Ministry have so far defended the National Exam. There is a site dedicated for groups that advocate the abolishment of the National Exam. ==== Exam fraud and cheating issues ==== Cheating is very rampant, because of the huge pressure to passing the exam. Schools and teachers are either ignoring it, encouraging it, or even do it. Examples include using mobile phones to send answers to other students, giving the answer key, either openly or discreetly, and changing\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Actuarial credentialing and exams\nContent: Hence, the highest grade achievable can be 9 for a test. SOA administers exam LTAM (previously MLC), which covers life contingencies topics. Starting in May 2014, MLC includes both multiple choice and open- response questions. SOA made this change because, in their view, strict multiple-choice questions are not sufficient or adequate to test whether candidates are familiar with and fluent in the material. The test is four hours long, allows calculators, and is administered via a paper-and-pencil format. Multiple-choice questions account for 40% of the exam, and open- response questions account for 60% of the exam. Candidates may freely move between the two sections. The two sections are graded separately. However, since the multiple-choice questions are easier, only candidates who have answered a certain percentage of the multiple-choice questions correctly have their written answers graded. For instance, a multiple-choice score of 24 points was needed to have written-answer questions graded for the April 2021 LTAM exam.

The massacre left at least 50 civilians dead as they were attempting to flee a blockade. It was the third attack to take place in Madjoari in May 2022, after an attack on 14 May that killed 17 civilians and another on 19 May that killed 11 soldiers. ==Background== Since 2015, Burkina Faso has been fighting jihadists linked to the Islamic State and al-Qaeda in some parts of the country. Civilians and soldiers in northern and eastern Burkina Faso are regularly attacked by the militants. Over 2,000 people have been killed and 1.8 million displaced. In January 2022, President Roch Marc Christian Kaboré was ousted in a military coup because of his lack of effort in managing the deteriorating security situation and in combating Islamist insurgents. ==Attack== On 25 May 2022, at least 50 civilians were shot dead in Madjoari, which was occupied by jihadists. Witnesses at the scene said that residents were trying to flee the blockaded area after having been deprived of supplies for a week, and that all the dead were men. The wounded were evacuated to Diapaga for treatment. Colonel Hubert Yameogo, the governor of the region, said the massacre was carried out by unidentified suspected jihadists. ==Reactions== The killing was condemned by UN Secretary-General António Guterres, whose spokesman issued a statement expressing Guterres's condolences to the families of the victims and reaffirming the United Nations' commitment to aiding Burkina Faso in managing the country's security situation. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry also condemned the killing and reaffirmed Egypt's \"full solidarity\" with Burkina Faso in its effort to combat the terrorist groups.\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Insecurity Insight\nContent: easy it is to hit the victim(s) in that context, and whether the victim(s) have already been hit.) ===How to use the model=== The method uses written reports of real incidents of armed violence as the source for the necessary values. Information from a report on an individual incident is entered into a spreadsheet specially designed to capture and process information about the people committing violence and about the victim(s) or potential victim(s). In this way, qualitative sources of data about violence i.e., reports, can be fed into a specially prepared relational database; this uses binaries and surrogates to give a numeric value to determinants such as intent and vulnerability. (For example, for vulnerability: Were the people herded into a confined space before being shot? Yes / No) A “report” can be a very short text as indicated by the following sentence: “Two masked men entered Hospital X last night and shot dead a sleeping patient.” In terms of entry into the database, this can be read as: Two masked men [number of people armed] entered Hospital X [where] last night [when] and shot [weapon (firearms)] dead [outcome] a [outcome] sleeping patient [vulnerability]. (\"Shot dead\" is also a comment on intent.) When the database has been fed with a sufficient number of reports of real events about a certain issue, this permits an “evidence-based” dialogue about the perpetrators and their intents and about the victims and their vulnerabilities. Taback and Coupland tested the model using global news reports about violence in general and about attacks on journalists.Taback, Nathan and Robin Coupland (2006). ”Security of Journalists: Making the Case for Modelling Armed Violence as a Means to Promote Human Security.” They went further and termed such an approach\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Casualties of the Iraq War\nContent: kinds of violence (car bombs, snipers or crossfire, kidnappings, fighting among opposing groups or abuse of civilians by various armed forces).\" Question 35 asked: \"Have you or an immediate family member – by which I mean someone living in this household – been physically harmed by the violence that is occurring in the country at this time?\" Here are the results in percentages: Groups Yes No No opinion All 17 83 0 Sunni 21 79 0 Shiite 17 83 0 Kurdish 7 93 0 17% of respondents reported that at least one member of the household had been \"physically harmed by the violence that is occurring in the country at this time.\" The survey did not ask whether multiple household members had been harmed. === Opinion Research Business (ORB) survey (2007, 2008) === A September 14, 2007, estimate by Opinion Research Business (ORB), an independent British polling agency, suggested that the total Iraqi violent death toll due to the Iraq War since the U.S.-led invasion was in excess of 1.2 million (1,220,580). These results were based on a survey of 1,499 adults in Iraq from August 12–19, 2007. ORB published an update in January 2008 based on additional work carried out in rural areas of Iraq. Some 600 additional interviews were undertaken and as a result of this the death estimate was revised to 1,033,000 with a given range of 946,000 to 1,120,000.\"Update on Iraqi Casualty Data\" by Opinion Research Business.

In 1966, Teitelbaum and Weiner stated that in foreign policy governments create mass migrations as a tool to achieve non migrant goals.Thomas Schelling, 1966, \"Arms and Influence\" New Haven, CT: Yale Univ.

They can be misleading and can report information that has nothing to do with the actual story. Negative words such as \"violence\" can be used when there was no violence involved. The media can also point to specific characteristics that are the reason for the crime that was committed. For example, a story can discuss a murder, but the headline might focus on the hoodie the culprit was wearing. Emphasizing the hoodie will draw attention to what the person was wearing instead of the murder that took place. This causes people to become paranoid and overreact when they see someone wearing clothing that looks suspicious. ===Prediction=== This is where the media speculates that an incident might occur again. The media can report that an event will occur in the future, which is not always the case. People involved describe what should be done the next time it happens and what precautions should be taken. Predicting the future can cause people to constantly think about what could go wrong and lead to catastrophe. This can cause major stress and cause people to have social panics more often. However, there are certain situations where making predictions is necessary for security, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and other natural disasters. ===Symbolization=== This involves stereotypes, words and images that possess symbolic powers that can cause different emotions. Symbolization can be described in three processes. It includes words such as \"deviant\" and, as Cohen would say, \"it becomes symbolic of a certain status.\" By this he means that the word represents something meaningful. Then the object, which can include clothing, represents the word. Therefore, the object can also symbolize the status. Neutral words can symbolize an event or emotion.

Under the law of war, it refers to civilians who perish or suffer wounds as a result of wartime acts. The term is generally applied to situations in which violence is committed in pursuit of political goals. During periods of armed conflict, there are structures, actors, and processes at a number of levels that affect the likelihood of violence against civilians. The term \"civilian casualties\" is sometimes used in non-military situations, for example to distinguish casualties to police vs. to criminals such as bank robbers. ==Overview== In times of armed conflict, despite numerous advancements in technology, the European Union's European Security Strategy, adopted by the European Council in Brussels in December 2003, stated that since 1990, almost 4 million people have died in wars, 90% of them civilians. However, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) reports that civilian fatalities have climbed from 5 per cent at the turn of the century to more than 90 per cent in the wars of the 1990s. Generating reliable assessments of casualties of war is a notoriously complex process. Civilian casualties present particular difficulties. One problem is that the attribution of the label 'civilian' is contested in some cases. On the surface, the definition of a civilian, at least in the context of international armed conflicts, is relatively simple: a civilian is any person who is not a member of the armed forces and is not a combatant in situation of armed conflict. To make effective use of such statistics as there are about civilian casualties of war, it is necessary to be explicit about the criteria for inclusion.

Just as the gamma function provides a continuous interpolation of the factorials, offset by one, the digamma function provides a continuous interpolation of the harmonic numbers, offset by the Euler–Mascheroni constant. ===Computation=== The factorial function is a common feature in scientific calculators. It is also included in scientific programming libraries such as the Python mathematical functions module and the Boost C++ library. If efficiency is not a concern, computing factorials is trivial: just successively multiply a variable initialized by the integers up The simplicity of this computation makes it a common example in the use of different computer programming styles and methods. The computation of n! can be expressed in pseudocode using iteration as define factorial(n): f := 1 for i := 1, 2, 3, ..., n: f := f * i return f or using recursion based on its recurrence relation as define factorial(n): if (n = 0) return 1 return n * factorial(n − 1) Other methods suitable for its computation include memoization, dynamic programming, and functional programming. The computational complexity of these algorithms may be analyzed using the unit- cost random-access machine model of computation, in which each arithmetic operation takes constant time and each number uses a constant amount of storage space. In this model, these methods can compute n! in time and the iterative version uses space Unless optimized for tail recursion, the recursive version takes linear space to store its call stack. See in particular p. 34. However, this model of computation is only suitable when n is small enough to allow n! to fit into a machine word. The values 12! and 20! are the largest factorials that can be stored in, respectively, the 32-bit and 64-bit\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Factorial\nContent: text: Selected factorials; values in scientific notation are rounded n n! 0 1 1 1 2 2 3 6 4 24 5 120 6 720 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 25 50 70 100 450 10 In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative denoted is the product of all positive integers less than or equal The factorial also equals the product of n with the next smaller factorial: \\begin{align} n! &= n \\times (n-1) \\times (n-2) \\times (n-3) \\times \\cdots \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\\\\\ &= n\\times(n-1)!\\\\\\ \\end{align} For example, 5! = 5\\times 4! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120.

Factorials have been discovered in several ancient cultures, notably in Indian mathematics in the canonical works of Jain literature, and by Jewish mystics in the Talmudic book Sefer Yetzirah. The factorial operation is encountered in many areas of mathematics, notably in combinatorics, where its most basic use counts the possible distinct sequences – the permutations – of n distinct objects: there In mathematical analysis, factorials are used in power series for the exponential function and other functions, and they also have applications in algebra, number theory, probability theory, and computer science. Much of the mathematics of the factorial function was developed beginning in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Stirling's approximation provides an accurate approximation to the factorial of large numbers, showing that it grows more quickly than exponential growth. Legendre's formula describes the exponents of the prime numbers in a prime factorization of the factorials, and can be used to count the trailing\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Factorial\nContent: computation of the factorial needs to have only the value for zero as a base case, simplifying the computation and avoiding the need for additional special cases. * Setting 0!=1 allows for the compact expression of many formulae, such as the exponential function, as a power series: * This choice matches the gamma function and the gamma function must have this value to be a continuous function. ==Applications== The earliest uses of the factorial function involve counting permutations: there are n! different ways of arranging n distinct objects into a sequence. Factorials appear more broadly in many formulas in combinatorics, to account for different orderings of objects. For instance the binomial coefficients \\tbinom{n}{k} count the combinations (subsets of from a set with and can be computed from factorials using the formula \\binom{n}{k}=\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}. The Stirling numbers of the first kind sum to the factorials, and count the permutations grouped into subsets with the same numbers of cycles. Another combinatorial application is in counting derangements, permutations that do not leave any element in its original position; the number of derangements of n items is the nearest integer In algebra, the factorials arise through the binomial theorem, which uses binomial coefficients to expand powers of sums. They also occur in the coefficients used to relate certain families of polynomials to each other, for instance in Newton's identities for symmetric polynomials. Their use in counting permutations can also be restated algebraically: the factorials are the orders of finite symmetric groups. In calculus, factorials occur in Faà di Bruno's formula for chaining higher derivatives. In mathematical analysis, factorials frequently appear in the denominators of power series, most notably in the series for the exponential function,\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Gamma function\nContent: describes the curve, in which the number of operations does not depend on the size of . The simple formula for the factorial, , cannot be used directly for non-integer values of since it is only valid when is a natural number (or positive integer). There are, relatively speaking, no such simple solutions for factorials; no finite combination of sums, products, powers, exponential functions, or logarithms will suffice to express ; but it is possible to find a general formula for factorials using tools such as integrals and limits from calculus. A good solution to this is the gamma function. There are infinitely many continuous extensions of the factorial to non-integers: infinitely many curves can be drawn through any set of isolated points. The gamma function is the most useful solution in practice, being analytic (except at the non-positive integers), and it can be defined in several equivalent ways. However, it is not the only analytic function that extends the factorial, as adding to it any analytic function that is zero on the positive integers, such as for an integer , will give another function with that property. Such a function is known as a pseudogamma function, the most famous being the Hadamard function. thumb|250px|The gamma function, in blue, plotted along with in green.

Daniel Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler interpolated the factorial function to a continuous function of complex numbers, except at the negative integers, the (offset) gamma function. Many other notable functions and number sequences are closely related to the factorials, including the binomial coefficients, double factorials, falling factorials, primorials, and subfactorials. Implementations of the factorial function are commonly used as an example of different computer programming styles, and are included in scientific calculators and scientific computing software libraries. Although directly computing large factorials using the product formula or recurrence is not efficient, faster algorithms are known, matching to within a constant factor the time for fast multiplication algorithms for numbers with the same number of digits. ==History== The concept of factorials has arisen independently in many cultures: *In Indian mathematics, one of the earliest known descriptions of factorials comes from the Anuyogadvāra-sūtra, one of the canonical works of Jain literature, which has been assigned dates varying from 300 BCE to 400 CE.. See discussion of dating on p. 211. It separates out the sorted and reversed order of a set of items from the other (\"mixed\") orders, evaluating the number of mixed orders by subtracting two from the usual product formula for the factorial. The product rule for permutations was also described by 6th-century CE Jain monk Jinabhadra.. Revised by K. S. Shukla from a paper in Indian Journal of History of Science 27 (3): 231–249, 1992, .

The factorial number system is sometimes defined with the 0! place omitted because it is always zero . In this article, a factorial number representation will be flagged by a subscript \"!\", so for instance 3:4:1:0:1:0! stands for 354413021100, whose value is : 3×5! + 4×4! + 1×3! + 0×2! + 1×1! + 0×0! : ((((3×5 + 4)×4 + 1)×3 + 0)×2 + 1)×1 + 0 : 46310. (The place value is the factorial of one less than the radix position, which is why the equation begins with 5! for a 6-digit factoradic number.) General properties of mixed radix number systems also apply to the factorial number system. For instance, one can convert a number into factorial representation producing digits from right to left, by repeatedly dividing the number by the radix (1, 2, 3, ...), taking the remainder as digits, and continuing with the integer quotient, until this quotient becomes 0. For example, 46310 can be transformed into a factorial representation by these successive divisions: : 463 ÷ 1 = 463, remainder 0 : 463 ÷ 2 = 231, remainder 1 : 231 ÷ 3 = 77, remainder 0 : 77 ÷ 4 = 19, remainder 1 : 19 ÷ 5 = 3, remainder 4 : 3 ÷ 6 = 0, remainder 3 The process terminates when the quotient reaches zero. Reading the remainders backward gives 3:4:1:0:1:0!. In principle, this system may be extended to represent fractional numbers, though rather than the natural extension of place values (−1)!, (−2)!, etc., which are undefined, the symmetric choice of radix values n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. after the point\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.\n\n[/INST]IDs: 1, 0, 2</s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

In ASCII or EBCDIC, case can be converted in the following way, in C: int toupper(int c) { return islower(c) ? c – 'a' + 'A' : c; } int tolower(int c) { return isupper(c) ? c – 'A' + 'a' : c; } This only works because the letters of upper and lower cases are spaced out equally. In ASCII they are consecutive, whereas with EBCDIC they are not; nonetheless the upper-case letters are arranged in the same pattern and with the same gaps as are the lower-case letters, so the technique still works. Some computer programming languages offer facilities for converting text to a form in which all words are capitalised. Visual Basic calls this \"proper case\"; Python calls it \"title case\". This differs from usual title casing conventions, such as the English convention in which minor words are not capitalised. ==History== Originally alphabets were written entirely in majuscule letters, spaced between well- defined upper and lower bounds. When written quickly with a pen, these tended to turn into rounder and much simpler forms. It is from these that the first minuscule hands developed, the half-uncials and cursive minuscule, which no longer stayed bound between a pair of lines. These in turn formed the foundations for the Carolingian minuscule script, developed by Alcuin\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Here document\nContent: normally in contexts where normal strings would: #lang racket (printf #< Outputs: Dear Isaac, Thanks for the insightful conversation yesterday.

A here-string is a string which starts with an open delimiter (`@\"` or `@'`) and ends with a close delimiter (`\"@` or `'@`) on a line by itself, which terminates the string. All characters between the open and close delimiter are considered the string literal. Using a here- string with double quotes allows variables to be interpreted, using single quotes doesn't. Variable interpolation occurs with simple variables (e.g. `$x` but NOT `$x.y` or `$x[0]`). You can execute a set of statements by putting them in `$()` (e.g. `$($x.y)` or `$(Get-Process | Out-String)`). In the following PowerShell code, text is passed to a function using a here-string.

For character input and output, `write-char`, `read-char`, `peek-char` and `char-ready?` are provided. For writing and reading Scheme expressions, Scheme provides `read` and `write`. On a read operation, the result returned is the end-of-file object if the input port has reached the end of the file, and this can be tested using the predicate `eof-object?`. In addition to the standard, SRFI 28 defines a basic formatting procedure resembling Common Lisp's `format` function, after which it is named. ===Redefinition of standard procedures=== In Scheme, procedures are bound to variables. At R5RS the language standard formally mandated that programs may change the variable bindings of built-in procedures, effectively redefining them. (R5RS \"Language changes\") For example, one may extend `+` to accept strings as well as numbers by redefining it: (set! + (let ((original+ +)) (lambda args (apply (if (or (null? args) (string? (car args))) string- append original+) args)))) (+ 1 2 3) ===> 6 (+ \"1\" \"2\" \"3\") ===> \"123\" In R6RS every binding, including the standard ones, belongs to some library, and all exported bindings are immutable. (R6RS sec 7.1) Because of this, redefinition of standard procedures by mutation is forbidden. Instead, it is possible to import a different procedure under the name of a standard one, which in effect is similar to redefinition. ===Nomenclature and naming conventions=== In Standard Scheme, procedures that convert from one datatype to another contain the character string \"->\" in their name, predicates end with a \"?\", and procedures that change the value of already-allocated data end with a \"!\". These conventions are often followed by Scheme programmers. In formal contexts such\n\nID: 4\nTitle: String literal\nContent: in `s,regex,replacement,` . ===Constructor functions=== Another option, which is rarely used in modern languages, is to use a function to construct a string, rather than representing it via a literal. This is generally not used in modern languages because the computation is done at run time, rather than at parse time. For example, early forms of BASIC did not include escape sequences or any other workarounds listed here, and thus one instead was required to use the `CHR$` function, which returns a string containing the character corresponding to its argument. In ASCII the quotation mark has the value 34, so to represent a string with quotes on an ASCII system one would write \"I said, \" + CHR$(34) + \"Can you hear me?\" + CHR$(34) In C, a similar facility is available via `sprintf` and the `%c` \"character\" format specifier, though in the presence of other workarounds this is generally not used: char buffer[32]; snprintf(buffer, sizeof buffer, \"This is %cin quotes.%c\", 34, 34); These constructor functions can also be used to represent nonprinting characters, though escape sequences are generally used instead. A similar technique can be used in C++ with the `std::string` stringification operator. == Escape sequences == Escape sequences are a general technique for representing characters that are otherwise difficult to represent directly, including delimiters, nonprinting characters (such as backspaces), newlines, and whitespace characters (which are otherwise impossible to distinguish visually), and have a long history. They are accordingly widely used in string literals, and adding an escape sequence (either to a single character or throughout a string) is known as escaping. One character is chosen as a prefix to give encodings for characters that are difficult or impossible to\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Wang BASIC\nContent: similar to in MS BASIC. searched a string and returned a numeric value within it. The function was similar to LEN, but returned the length of the length of the substring up to the first non-numeric character. For instance, if A$ is \"1234.5\", would return 6, whereas if A$ was \"1234.5 \" NUM would return 10, because spaces are valid in numbers. 2200B did not add a STR$ function, which converts a numeric value to a string. Instead, they added the command to read strings into numbers and vice versa. For instance, using the A$ above, would result in B containing the value 1234.5, while would leave B$ with something like \"123 \". Dartmouth BASIC included a CHANGE command but it was very different in purpose, in Dartmouth, would produce an array of values in B, with each element containing the ASCII code for the corresponding character in A$; in this case, B would contain 49,50,51,52,46,53, the ASCII values for the characters \"1234.5\". Wang's CONVERT also had a second mode that took a format specifier like PRINTUSING and used that to convert a number to a formatted string in a fashion analogous to C's sprintf. The function returns the index of a given character in a string; would return 3. In contrast to MS's , POS could search for only a single character, not a multi-character string. converted a hexadecimal value into the corresponding character. For instance, would put a space character (hex 20) into the first character of A$. Multiple codes could be inserted at once; produces three characters, two backspaces and a cursor-right.

The ROM also included a much larger variety of math functions, including . converted a floating point number into a string, as was the case for in other dialects, but in this case, the string was written to memory and the function returned the address where it was stored. As the string required storage long enough to hold it, this was often accomplished using TOP.

One oddity came about because the colon and semicolon were already used for other purposes, leaving only the comma to separate fields. To print values with no spaces between them, the values were listed with a space character between them, like , a format that was also allowed on many other dialects although rarely used. This alone would not cause numbers to be printed in compact format, because they are normally printed with spaces on the right to make each one 8 characters wide This could be adjusted by changing the value in the pseudo-variable.

Arithmetically, it means given S, a procedure for finding a number which when multiplied by itself, yields S; algebraically, it means a procedure for finding the non-negative root of the equation x^2-S=0; geometrically, it means given two line segments, a procedure for constructing their geometric mean. Every real number except zero has two square roots. In addition to the principal square root, there is a negative square root equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the principal square root, except for zero, which has double square roots of zero. The principal square root of most numbers is an irrational number with an infinite decimal expansion. As a result, the decimal expansion of any such square root can only be computed to some finite-precision approximation. However, even if we are taking the square root of a perfect square integer, so that the result does have an exact finite representation, the procedure used to compute it may only return a series of increasingly accurate approximations. The continued fraction representation of a real number can be used instead of its decimal or binary expansion and this representation has the property that the square root of any rational number (which is not already a perfect square) has a periodic, repeating expansion, similar to how rational numbers have repeating expansions in the decimal notation system. The most common analytical methods are iterative and consist of two steps: finding a suitable starting value, followed by iterative refinement until some termination criterion is met. The starting value can be any number, but fewer iterations will be required the closer\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Methods of computing square roots\nContent: or as a hardware operator, based on one of the described procedures. ==Initial estimate== Many iterative square root algorithms require an initial seed value. The seed must be a non-zero positive number; it should be between 1 and S, the number whose square root is desired, because the square root must be in that range. If the seed is far away from the root, the algorithm will require more iterations. If one initializes with x_0=1 (or S), then approximately \\tfrac12 \\vert \\log_2 S \\vert iterations will be wasted just getting the order of magnitude of the root. It is therefore useful to have a rough estimate, which may have limited accuracy but is easy to calculate. In general, the better the initial estimate, the faster the convergence. For Newton's method (also called Babylonian or Heron's method), a seed somewhat larger than the root will converge slightly faster than a seed somewhat smaller than the root. In general, an estimate is pursuant to an arbitrary interval known to contain the root (such as [x_0,S/x_0]). The estimate is a specific value of a functional approximation to f(x)=\\sqrt{x} over the interval. Obtaining a better estimate involves either obtaining tighter bounds on the interval, or finding a better functional approximation to f(x). The latter usually means using a higher order polynomial in the approximation, though not all approximations are polynomial. Common methods of estimating include scalar, linear, hyperbolic and logarithmic. A decimal base is usually used for mental or paper-and-pencil estimating. A binary base is more suitable for computer estimates. In estimating, the exponent and mantissa are usually treated separately, as the number would be expressed in scientific notation. ===Decimal estimates=== Typically the number S is expressed in scientific\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Methods of computing square roots\nContent: The principal square root of a complex number is defined to be the root with the non-negative real part. == See also == * Alpha max plus beta min algorithm * nth root algorithm * Square root of 2 * Integer square root == Notes == == References == == Bibliography== == External links == * * Square roots by subtraction * Integer Square Root Algorithm by Andrija Radović * Personal Calculator Algorithms I : Square Roots (William E.

In this case only 4 iteration steps are needed. ==Digit-by-digit algorithm== The traditional pen-and-paper algorithm for computing the square root \\sqrt{n} is based on working from higher digit places to lower, and as each new digit pick the largest that will still yield a square \\leq n. If stopping after the one's place, the result computed will be the integer square root. ===Using bitwise operations=== If working in base 2, the choice of digit is simplified to that between 0 (the \"small candidate\") and 1 (the \"large candidate\"), and digit manipulations can be expressed in terms of binary shift operations. With `*` being multiplication, `<<` being left shift, and `>>` being logical right shift, a recursive algorithm to find the integer square root of any natural number is: def integer_sqrt(n: int) -> int: assert n >= 0, \"sqrt works for only non-negative inputs\" if n < 2: return n # Recursive call: small_cand = integer_sqrt(n >> 2) << 1 large_cand = small_cand + 1 if large_cand * large_cand > n: return small_cand else: return large_cand # equivalently: def integer_sqrt_iter(n: int) -> int: assert n >= 0, \"sqrt works for only non- negative inputs\" if n < 2: return n # Find the shift amount.

The most familiar such method, most suited for programmatic calculation, is Newton's method, which is based on a property of the derivative in the calculus. A few methods like paper-and-pencil synthetic division and series expansion, do not require a starting value. In some applications, an integer square root is required, which is the square root rounded or truncated to the nearest integer (a modified procedure may be employed in this case). The method employed depends on what the result is to be used for (i.e. how accurate it has to be), how much effort one is willing to put into the procedure, and what tools are at hand. The methods may be roughly classified as those suitable for mental calculation, those usually requiring at least paper and pencil, and those which are implemented as programs to be executed on a digital electronic computer or other computing device. Algorithms may take into account convergence (how many iterations are required to achieve a specified precision), computational complexity of individual operations (i.e. division) or iterations, and error propagation (the accuracy of the final result). Procedures for finding square roots (particularly the square root of 2) have been known since at least the period of ancient Babylon in the 17th century BCE. Heron's method from first century Egypt was the first ascertainable algorithm for computing square root. Modern analytic methods began to be developed after introduction of the Arabic numeral system to western Europe in the early Renaissance. Today, nearly all computing devices have a fast and accurate square root function, either as a programming language construct, a compiler intrinsic or library function, or as a hardware operator, based on one of the\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Square root of 2\nContent: text: }} }} The square root of 2 (approximately 1.4142) is a positive real number that, when multiplied by itself, equals the number 2. It may be written in mathematics as \\sqrt{2} or 2^{1/2}, and is an algebraic number. Technically, it should be called the principal square root of 2, to distinguish it from the negative number with the same property. Geometrically, the square root of 2 is the length of a diagonal across a square with sides of one unit of length; this follows from the Pythagorean theorem. It was probably the first number known to be irrational. The fraction (≈ 1.4142857) is sometimes used as a good rational approximation with a reasonably small denominator. Sequence in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences consists of the digits in the decimal expansion of the square root of 2, here truncated to 65 decimal places: : ==History== The Babylonian clay tablet YBC 7289 (–1600 BC) gives an approximation of \\sqrt{2} in four sexagesimal figures, , which is accurate to about six decimal digits,Fowler and Robson, p. 368.

It is more precisely called the principal square root of 7, to distinguish it from the negative number with the same property. This number appears in various geometric and number-theoretic contexts. It can be denoted in surd form as: :\\sqrt{7}\\, , and in exponent form as: :7^\\frac{1}{2}. It is an irrational algebraic number. The first sixty significant digits of its decimal expansion are: :. which can be rounded up to 2.646 to within about 99.99% accuracy (about 1 part in 10000); that is, it differs from the correct value by about . The approximation (≈ 2.645833...) is better: despite having a denominator of only 48, it differs from the correct value by less than , or less than one part in 33,000. More than a million decimal digits of the square root of seven have been published. ==Rational approximations== thumb|left|Explanation of how to extract the square root of 7 to 7 places and more, from Hawney, 1797 The extraction of decimal-fraction approximations to square roots by various methods has used the square root of 7 as an example or exercise in textbooks, for hundreds of years. Different numbers of digits after the decimal point are shown: 5 in 1773 and 1852, 3 in 1835, 6 in 1808, and 7 in 1797. An extraction by Newton's method (approximately) was illustrated in 1922, concluding that it is 2.646 \"to the nearest thousandth\". For a family of good rational approximations, the square root of 7 can be expressed as the continued fraction : [2; 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4,\\ldots] =\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Methods of computing square roots\nContent: Here since the place value of Y_m is an even power of 10, we only need to work with the pair of most significant digits of the remaining term X_{m-1} at any m-th stage. The section below codifies this procedure. It is obvious that a similar method can be used to compute the square root in number systems other than the decimal number system. For instance, finding the digit-by-digit square root in the binary number system is quite efficient since the value of a_i is searched from a smaller set of binary digits {0,1}. This makes the computation faster since at each stage the value of Y_m is either Y_m = 0 for a_m = 0 or Y_m = 2 P_{m-1} + 1 for a_m = 1. The fact that we have only two possible options for a_m also makes the process of deciding the value of a_m at m-th stage of calculation easier. This is because we only need to check if Y_m \\leq X_{m-1} for a_m = 1. If this condition is satisfied, then we take a_m = 1; if not then a_m = 0. Also, the fact that multiplication by 2 is done by left bit-shifts helps in the computation. ===Decimal (base 10)=== Write the original number in decimal form. The numbers are written similar to the long division algorithm, and, as in long division, the root will be written on the line above. Now separate the digits into pairs, starting from the decimal point and going both left and right. The decimal point of the root will be above the decimal point of the square. One digit of the root will appear above each pair of digits of the square.

Where it is still desirable to reduce the overhead of a linked list, unrolling provides a more practical approach (as well as other advantages, such as increasing cache performance and speeding random access). ==Variations== The underlying principle of the XOR linked list can be applied to any reversible binary operation. Replacing XOR by addition or subtraction gives slightly different, but largely equivalent, formulations: ===Addition linked list=== ... A B C D E ... ⇌ A+C ⇌ B+D ⇌ C+E ⇌ This kind of list has exactly the same properties as the XOR linked list, except that a zero link field is not a \"mirror\". The address of the next node in the list is given by subtracting the previous node's address from the current node's link field. ===Subtraction linked list=== ... A B C D E ... ⇌ C-A ⇌ D-B ⇌ E-C ⇌ This kind of list differs from the standard \"traditional\" XOR linked list in that the instruction sequences needed to traverse the list forwards is different from the sequence needed to traverse the list in reverse. The address of the next node, going forwards, is given by adding the link field to the previous node's address; the address of the preceding node is given by subtracting the link field from the next node's address. The subtraction linked list is also special in that the entire list can be relocated in memory without needing any patching of pointer values, since adding a constant offset to each address in the list will not require any changes to the values stored in the link fields. (See also serialization.) This is an advantage over both XOR linked lists and traditional linked\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Finger search\nContent: from y is typically accomplished by reversing the search process from y until the search interval is large enough to contain x, at which point search proceeds as normal. ===Sorted linked lists=== In a linked list, one normally searches linearly for an element by walking from one end to the other. If the linked list is sorted, and we have a reference to some node containing y, then we may find x in O(d) time by starting our search from y. ===Sorted arrays=== In a sorted array A, one normally searches for an element x in A with a binary search. Finger search is accomplished by performing a one-sided search from A[j] = y. While binary search halves the search space after each comparison, one-sided search doubles the search space after each comparison. Specifically, on the kth iteration of one-sided search (assuming x > y), the interval under consideration is A[j, j+2k-1]. Expansion halts as soon as A[j + 2k-1] ≥ x, at which point this interval is binary searched for x. If one-sided search takes k iterations to find an interval that contains x, then it follows that d > 2k-2. Binary searching this range will also take another k iterations. Therefore, finger search for x from y takes O(k) = O(log d) time. ===Skip lists=== In a skip list, one can finger search for x from a node containing the element y by simply continuing the search from this point. Note that if x < y, then search proceeds backwards, and if x > y, then search proceeds forwards. The backwards case is symmetric to normal search in a skip list, but the forward case is actually more complex. Normally, search in a skiplist is expected\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Double-ended queue\nContent: `(len_front, front, tail_front, len_rear, rear, tail_rear)` where `front` is a linked list which contains the front of the queue of length `len_front`. Similarly, `rear` is a linked list which represents the reverse of the rear of the queue, of length `len_rear`. Furthermore, it is assured that `|front| ≤ 2|rear|+1` and `|rear| ≤ 2|front|+1` \\- intuitively, it means that both the front and the rear contains between a third minus one and two thirds plus one of the elements. Finally, `tail_front` and `tail_rear` are tails of `front` and of `rear`, they allow scheduling the moment where some lazy operations are forced. Note that, when a double-ended queue contains `n` elements in the front list and `n` elements in the rear list, then the inequality invariant remains satisfied after `i` insertions and `d` deletions when `(i+d) ≤ n/2`. That is, at most `n/2` operations can happen between each rebalancing. Let us first give an implementation of the various operations that affect the front of the deque - cons, head and tail. Those implementation do not necessarily respect the invariant. In a second time we'll explain how to modify a deque which does not satisfy the invariant into one which satisfy it. However, they use the invariant, in that if the front is empty then the rear has at most one element. The operations affecting the rear of the list are defined similarly by symmetry. empty = (0, NIL, NIL, 0, NIL, NIL) fun insert'(x, (len_front, front, tail_front, len_rear, rear, tail_rear)) = (len_front+1, CONS(x, front), drop(2, tail_front), len_rear, rear, drop(2, tail_rear)) fun head((_, CONS(h, _), _, _, _, _)) = h fun\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Linked list\nContent: the next-node link, a second link field pointing to the 'previous' node in the sequence. The two links may be called 'forward('s') and 'backwards', or 'next' and 'prev'('previous'). frame|center|A doubly linked list whose nodes contain three fields: an integer value, the link forward to the next node, and the link backward to the previous node A technique known as XOR-linking allows a doubly linked list to be implemented using a single link field in each node. However, this technique requires the ability to do bit operations on addresses, and therefore may not be available in some high-level languages. Many modern operating systems use doubly linked lists to maintain references to active processes, threads, and other dynamic objects. A common strategy for rootkits to evade detection is to unlink themselves from these lists. ===Multiply linked list=== In a 'multiply linked list', each node contains two or more link fields, each field being used to connect the same set of data arranged in a different order (e.g., by name, by department, by date of birth, etc.). While a doubly linked list can be seen as a special case of multiply linked list, the fact that the two and more orders are opposite to each other leads to simpler and more efficient algorithms, so they are usually treated as a separate case. ===Circular linked list=== In the last node of a linked list, the link field often contains a null reference, a special value is used to indicate the lack of further nodes. A less common convention is to make it point to the first node of the list; in that case, the list is said to be 'circular' or 'circularly linked'; otherwise, it is said to be 'open'\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Linked list\nContent: it finds that person. A dynamic array, on the other hand, will be poor at deleting nodes (or elements) as it cannot remove one node without individually shifting all the elements up the list by one. However, it is exceptionally easy to find the nth person in the circle by directly referencing them by their position in the array. The list ranking problem concerns the efficient conversion of a linked list representation into an array. Although trivial for a conventional computer, solving this problem by a parallel algorithm is complicated and has been the subject of much research. A balanced tree has similar memory access patterns and space overhead to a linked list while permitting much more efficient indexing, taking O(log n) time instead of O(n) for a random access. However, insertion and deletion operations are more expensive due to the overhead of tree manipulations to maintain balance. Schemes exist for trees to automatically maintain themselves in a balanced state: AVL trees or red–black trees. ===Singly linked linear lists vs. other lists=== While doubly linked and circular lists have advantages over singly linked linear lists, linear lists offer some advantages that make them preferable in some situations. A singly linked linear list is a recursive data structure, because it contains a pointer to a smaller object of the same type. For that reason, many operations on singly linked linear lists (such as merging two lists, or enumerating the elements in reverse order) often have very simple recursive algorithms, much simpler than any solution using iterative commands. While those recursive solutions can be adapted for doubly linked and circularly linked lists, the procedures generally need extra arguments and more complicated base cases. Linear singly linked lists also allow tail-sharing, the use of a\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Linked list\nContent: linked lists also allow tail-sharing, the use of a common final portion of sub-list as the terminal portion of two different lists. In particular, if a new node is added at the beginning of a list, the former list remains available as the tail of the new one—a simple example of a persistent data structure. Again, this is not true with the other variants: a node may never belong to two different circular or doubly linked lists. In particular, end-sentinel nodes can be shared among singly linked non-circular lists. The same end-sentinel node may be used for every such list. In Lisp, for example, every proper list ends with a link to a special node, denoted by `nil` or `()`, whose `CAR` and `CDR` links point to itself. Thus a Lisp procedure can safely take the `CAR` or `CDR` of any list. The advantages of the fancy variants are often limited to the complexity of the algorithms, not in their efficiency. A circular list, in particular, can usually be emulated by a linear list together with two variables that point to the first and last nodes, at no extra cost. ===Doubly linked vs. singly linked=== Double-linked lists require more space per node (unless one uses XOR-linking), and their elementary operations are more expensive; but they are often easier to manipulate because they allow fast and easy sequential access to the list in both directions. In a doubly linked list, one can insert or delete a node in a constant number of operations given only that node's address. To do the same in a singly linked list, one must have the address of the pointer to that node, which is either the handle for the whole list (in case of the\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Queue (abstract data type)\nContent: for each element in the reverse to when it was inserted. ===Real-time queue=== The real-time queue achieves O(1) time for all operations, without amortization. This discussion will be technical, so recall that, for l a list, |l| denotes its length, that NIL represents an empty list and \\operatorname{CONS}(h,t) represents the list whose head is h and whose tail is t. The data structure used to implement our queues consists of three singly-linked lists (f,r,s) where f is the front of the queue, r is the rear of the queue in reverse order. The invariant of the structure is that s is the rear of f without its |r| first elements, that is |s|=|f|-|r|. The tail of the queue (\\operatorname{CONS}(x,f),r,s) is then almost (f,r,s) and inserting an element x to (f,r,s) is almost (f,\\operatorname{CONS}(x,r),s). It is said almost, because in both of those results, |s|=|f|-|r|+1. An auxiliary function aux must then be called for the invariant to be satisfied. Two cases must be considered, depending on whether s is the empty list, in which case |r|=|f|+1, or not. The formal definition is \\operatorname{aux}(f,r,\\operatorname{Cons}(\\\\_,s))=(f,r,s) and \\operatorname{aux}(f,r,\\text{NIL})=(f',\\text{NIL},f') where f' is f followed by r reversed. Let us call \\operatorname{reverse}(f,r) the function which returns f followed by r reversed. Let us furthermore assume that |r|=|f|+1, since it is the case when this function is called. More precisely, we define a lazy function \\operatorname{rotate}(f,r,a) which takes as input three list such that |r|=|f|+1, and return the concatenation of f, of r reversed and of a. Then\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Linked list\nContent: of O(n). Appending one linked list to another can be inefficient unless a reference to the tail is kept as part of the List structure, because we must traverse the entire first list in order to find the tail, and then append the second list to this. Thus, if two linearly linked lists are each of length n, list appending has asymptotic time complexity of O(n). In the Lisp family of languages, list appending is provided by the `append` procedure. Many of the special cases of linked list operations can be eliminated by including a dummy element at the front of the list. This ensures that there are no special cases for the beginning of the list and renders both `insertBeginning()` and `removeBeginning()` unnecessary, i.e., every element or node is next to another node (even the first node is next to the dummy node). In this case, the first useful data in the list will be found at `list.firstNode.next`. ===Circularly linked list=== In a circularly linked list, all nodes are linked in a continuous circle, without using null. For lists with a front and a back (such as a queue), one stores a reference to the last node in the list. The next node after the last node is the first node. Elements can be added to the back of the list and removed from the front in constant time. Circularly linked lists can be either singly or doubly linked. Both types of circularly linked lists benefit from the ability to traverse the full list beginning at any given node. This often allows us to avoid storing firstNode and lastNode, although if the list may be empty we need a special representation for the empty list, such as\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Reverse a linked list.\n\n[/INST]IDs: 3, 5</s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

This subsequence is not necessarily contiguous or unique. The longest increasing subsequences are studied in the context of various disciplines related to mathematics, including algorithmics, random matrix theory, representation theory, and physics.. The longest increasing subsequence problem is solvable in time O(n \\log n), where n denotes the length of the input sequence. ==Example== In the first 16 terms of the binary Van der Corput sequence :0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15 a longest increasing subsequence is :0, 2, 6, 9, 11, 15. This subsequence has length six; the input sequence has no seven-member increasing subsequences. The longest increasing subsequence in this example is not the only solution: for instance, :0, 4, 6, 9, 11, 15 :0, 2, 6, 9, 13, 15 :0, 4, 6, 9, 13, 15 are other increasing subsequences of equal length in the same input sequence. ==Relations to other algorithmic problems== The longest increasing subsequence problem is closely related to the longest common subsequence problem, which has a quadratic time dynamic programming solution: the longest increasing subsequence of a sequence S is the longest common subsequence of S and T, where T is the result of sorting S. However, for the special case in which the input is a permutation of the integers 1, 2, \\ldots, n, this approach can be made much more efficient, leading to time bounds of the form O(n \\log \\log\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Longest increasing subsequence\nContent: to time bounds of the form O(n \\log \\log n). The largest clique in a permutation graph corresponds to the longest decreasing subsequence of the permutation that defines the graph (assuming the original non-permuted sequence is sorted from lowest value to highest). Similarly, the maximum independent set in a permutation graph corresponds to the longest non-decreasing subsequence. Therefore, longest increasing subsequence algorithms can be used to solve the clique problem efficiently in permutation graphs.. In the Robinson–Schensted correspondence between permutations and Young tableaux, the length of the first row of the tableau corresponding to a permutation equals the length of the longest increasing subsequence of the permutation, and the length of the first column equals the length of the longest decreasing subsequence.. ==Efficient algorithms== The algorithm outlined below solves the longest increasing subsequence problem efficiently with arrays and binary searching. It processes the sequence elements in order, maintaining the longest increasing subsequence found so far. Denote the sequence values as X[0], X[1], \\ldots, etc. Then, after processing X[i], the algorithm will have stored an integer L and values in two arrays: * L — stores the length of the longest increasing subsequence found so far. * M[l] — stores the index k of the smallest value X[k] such that there is an increasing subsequence of length l ending at X[k] in the range k \\leq i. Explicitly, suppose that K_{i,l} denotes the set of all indices j such that j \\leq i and there exists an increasing subsequence of length l ending at X[j]. Then k = M[l] is the index in K_{i,l} for which X[M[l]] is minimized; meaning that M[l] \\in K_{i,l} and X[M[l]]\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Longest increasing subsequence\nContent: found yet, update L L = newL // Reconstruct the longest increasing subsequence // It consists of the values of X at the L indices: // ..., P[P[M[L]]], P[M[L]], M[L] S = array of length L k = M[L] for j in range L-1 to 0: S[j] = X[k] k = P[k] return S Because the algorithm performs a single binary search per sequence element, its total time can be expressed using Big O notation as O(n \\log n). discusses a variant of this algorithm, which he credits to Donald Knuth; in the variant that he studies, the algorithm tests whether each value X[i] can be used to extend the current longest increasing sequence, in constant time, prior to doing the binary search.

Although this problem can be solved using several different algorithmic techniques, including brute force, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and reduction to shortest paths, a simple single-pass algorithm known as Kadane's algorithm solves it efficiently. == History == The maximum subarray problem was proposed by Ulf Grenander in 1977 as a simplified model for maximum likelihood estimation of patterns in digitized images. Grenander was looking to find a rectangular subarray with maximum sum, in a two-dimensional array of real numbers. A brute-force algorithm for the two-dimensional problem runs in O(n6) time; because this was prohibitively slow, Grenander proposed the one-dimensional problem to gain insight into its structure. Grenander derived an algorithm that solves the one-dimensional problem in O(n2) time, improving the brute force running time of O(n3). When Michael Shamos heard about the problem, he overnight devised an O(n log n) divide-and-conquer algorithm for it. Soon after, Shamos described the one-dimensional problem and its history at a Carnegie Mellon University seminar attended by Jay Kadane, who designed within a minute an O(n)-time algorithm, which is as fast as possible.since every algorithm must at least scan the array once which already takes O(n) time In 1982, David Gries obtained the same O(n)-time algorithm by applying Dijkstra's \"standard strategy\"; in 1989, Richard Bird derived it by purely algebraic manipulation of the brute-force algorithm using the Bird–Meertens formalism. Grenander's two-dimensional generalization can be solved in O(n3) time either by using Kadane's algorithm as a subroutine, or through a divide-and-conquer approach. Slightly faster algorithms based on distance matrix multiplication have been proposed\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Longest common substring\nContent: j] := L[i − 1, j − 1] + 1 if L[i, j] > z z := L[i, j] ret := {S[i − z + 1..i]} else if L[i, j] = z ret := ret ∪ {S[i − z + 1..i]} else L[i, j] := 0 return ret This algorithm runs in O(n r) time. The array `L` stores the length of the longest common substring of the prefixes `S[1..i]` and `T[1..j]` which end at position `i` and `j`, respectively. The variable `z` is used to hold the length of the longest common substring found so far. The set `ret` is used to hold the set of strings which are of length `z`. The set `ret` can be saved efficiently by just storing the index `i`, which is the last character of the longest common substring (of size z) instead of `S[i-z+1..i]`. Thus all the longest common substrings would be, for each i in `ret`, `S[(ret[i]-z)..(ret[i])]`. The following tricks can be used to reduce the memory usage of an implementation: * Keep only the last and current row of the DP table to save memory (O(\\min(r, n)) instead of O(n r)) ** The last and current row can be stored on the same 1D array by traversing the inner loop backwards * Store only non-zero values in the rows. This can be done using hash-tables instead of arrays.

Alternatively, by Dilworth's theorem itself, either there is an antichain of length s, or the sequence can be partitioned into at most s − 1 chains, the longest of which must have length at least r. === Application of the Robinson–Schensted correspondence === The result can also be obtained as a corollary of the Robinson–Schensted correspondence. Recall that the Robinson–Schensted correspondence associates to each sequence a Young tableau P whose entries are the values of the sequence. The tableau P has the following properties: * The length of the longest increasing subsequence is equal to the length of the first row of P. * The length of the longest decreasing subsequence is equal to the length of the first column of P. Now, it is not possible to fit (r − 1)(s − 1) + 1 entries in a square box of size (r − 1)(s − 1), so that either the first row is of length at least r or the last row is of length at least s. == See also == * Longest increasing subsequence problem == References == == External links == * Category:Ramsey theory Category:Permutation patterns Category:Theorems in discrete geometry Category:Articles containing proofs Szekeres theorem Category:Theorems in discrete mathematics\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Longest increasing subsequence\nContent: zero-based numbering, for clarity M is padded with M[0], which goes unused so that M[l] corresponds to a subsequence of length l.

For, if there is an increasing subsequence of length l \\geq 2 ending at X[M[l]], then there is also a subsequence of length l - 1 ending at a smaller value: namely the one ending at X[P[M[l]]].

Ideally, we would like R to be the maximum revenue that can be extracted from the market. However, we do not know this maximum revenue in advance. We can try to estimate it using one of the following ways: 1\\. Random sampling: ::randomly partition the bidders to two groups, such that each bidder has a chance of 1/2 to go to each group. Let R1 be the maximum revenue in group 1 and R2 the maximum revenue in group 2. Run R1-profit-extractor in group 2, and R2-profit-extractor in group 1. This mechanism guarantees a profit of at least 1/4 the maximum profit. A variant of this mechanism partitions the agents to three groups instead of two, and attains at least 1/3.25 of the maximum profit. 2\\. Consensus estimate: ::Calculate the maximum revenue in the entire population; apply a certain random rounding process that guarantees that the calculation is truthful with-high-probability. Let R be the estimated revenue; run R-profit-extractor in the entire population. This mechanism guarantees a profit of at least 1/3.39 the maximum profit, in a digital goods auction. == Profit extraction in a double auction == The profit- extraction idea can be generalized to arbitrary single-parameter utility agents. In particular, it can be used in a double auction where several sellers sell a single unit of some item (with different costs) and several buyers want at most a single unit of that item (with different valuations). The following mechanism is an approximate profit extractor: * Order the buyers by descending price and the sellers by ascending price. * Find the\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Algorithmic trading\nContent: the most important being volatility and liquidity of the stock. For example, for a highly liquid stock, matching a certain percentage of the overall orders of stock (called volume inline algorithms) is usually a good strategy, but for a highly illiquid stock, algorithms try to match every order that has a favorable price (called liquidity-seeking algorithms). The success of these strategies is usually measured by comparing the average price at which the entire order was executed with the average price achieved through a benchmark execution for the same duration. Usually, the volume-weighted average price is used as the benchmark. At times, the execution price is also compared with the price of the instrument at the time of placing the order. A special class of these algorithms attempts to detect algorithmic or iceberg orders on the other side (i.e. if you are trying to buy, the algorithm will try to detect orders for the sell side). These algorithms are called sniffing algorithms. A typical example is \"Stealth\".

Their solution follows from the odds strategy, and the importance of the odds strategy lies in its optimality, as explained below. The odds algorithm applies to a class of problems called last-success problems. Formally, the objective in these problems is to maximize the probability of identifying in a sequence of sequentially observed independent events the last event satisfying a specific criterion (a \"specific event\"). This identification must be done at the time of observation. No revisiting of preceding observations is permitted. Usually, a specific event is defined by the decision maker as an event that is of true interest in the view of \"stopping\" to take a well-defined action. Such problems are encountered in several situations. ==Examples== Two different situations exemplify the interest in maximizing the probability to stop on a last specific event. # Suppose a car is advertised for sale to the highest bidder (best \"offer\"). Let n potential buyers respond and ask to see the car. Each insists upon an immediate decision from the seller to accept the bid, or not. Define a bid as interesting, and coded 1 if it is better than all preceding bids, and coded 0 otherwise. The bids will form a random sequence of 0s and 1s. Only 1s interest the seller, who may fear that each successive 1 might be the last. It follows from the definition that the very last 1 is the highest bid. Maximizing the probability of selling on the last 1 therefore means maximizing the probability of selling best. # A physician, using a special treatment, may use the code\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Algorithmic trading\nContent: the ZIP algorithm had been invented at HP by Dave Cliff (professor) in 1996. In their paper, the IBM team wrote that the financial impact of their results showing MGD and ZIP outperforming human traders \"...might be measured in billions of dollars annually\"; the IBM paper generated international media coverage. In 2005, the Regulation National Market System was put in place by the SEC to strengthen the equity market. This changed the way firms traded with rules such as the Trade Through Rule, which mandates that market orders must be posted and executed electronically at the best available price, thus preventing brokerages from profiting from the price differences when matching buy and sell orders. As more electronic markets opened, other algorithmic trading strategies were introduced. These strategies are more easily implemented by computers, as they can react rapidly to price changes and observe several markets simultaneously. Many broker-dealers offered algorithmic trading strategies to their clients - differentiating them by behavior, options and branding. Examples include Chameleon (developed by BNP Paribas), Stealth (developed by the Deutsche Bank), Sniper and Guerilla (developed by Credit Suisse). These implementations adopted practices from the investing approaches of arbitrage, statistical arbitrage, trend following, and mean reversion.

This means that the strategy is enhanced by using data-driven calibration, but also insights. Furthermore, the use of particle swarm optimization can achieve a bid-offer discount without increasing the risk profile of a trading agent. A deeper analysis and dive into machine learning in systematic trading can be found under Alvarez Teleña's thesis at the University College of London and book Trading 2.0: Learning Adaptive Machines. Subsequently, his findings led to the emergence of a new unit at the bank BBVA, called Global Strategies & Data Science. === Trading ahead of index fund rebalancing === Most retirement savings, such as private pension funds or 401(k) and individual retirement accounts in the US, are invested in mutual funds, the most popular of which are index funds which must periodically \"rebalance\" or adjust their portfolio to match the new prices and market capitalization of the underlying securities in the stock or other index that they track. Profits are transferred from passive index investors to active investors, some of whom are algorithmic traders specifically exploiting the index rebalance effect. The magnitude of these losses incurred by passive investors has been estimated at 21–28bp per year for the S&P; 500 and 38–77bp per year for the Russell 2000. John Montgomery of Bridgeway Capital Management says that the resulting \"poor investor returns\" from trading ahead of mutual funds is \"the elephant in the room\" that \"shockingly, people are not talking about\". === Pairs trading === Pairs trading or pair trading is a long-short, ideally market-neutral strategy enabling traders to profit from transient discrepancies in relative value of close\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Algorithmic trading\nContent: that the price will rise. When the current market price is above the average price, the market price is expected to fall. In other words, deviations from the average price are expected to revert to the average. The standard deviation of the most recent prices (e.g., the last 20) is often used as a buy or sell indicator. Stock reporting services (such as Yahoo! Finance, MS Investor, Morningstar, etc.), commonly offer moving averages for periods such as 50 and 100 days. While reporting services provide the averages, identifying the high and low prices for the study period is still necessary. === Scalping === Scalping is liquidity provision by non-traditional market makers, whereby traders attempt to earn (or make) the bid-ask spread. This procedure allows for profit for so long as price moves are less than this spread and normally involves establishing and liquidating a position quickly, usually within minutes or less. A market maker is basically a specialized scalper. The volume a market maker trades is many times more than the average individual scalper and would make use of more sophisticated trading systems and technology. However, registered market makers are bound by exchange rules stipulating their minimum quote obligations. For instance, NASDAQ requires each market maker to post at least one bid and one ask at some price level, so as to maintain a two-sided market for each stock represented. === Transaction cost reduction === Most strategies referred to as algorithmic trading (as well as algorithmic liquidity-seeking) fall into the cost-reduction category. The basic idea is to break down a large order into small orders and place them in the market over time. The choice of algorithm depends on various factors, with the most important being volatility and liquidity of the\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Odds algorithm\nContent: + \\cdots + r_s. \\, If the sum of the odds does not reach 1, it sets s = 1\\.

The importance of the odds strategy, and hence of the odds algorithm, lies in the following odds theorem. ==Odds theorem == The odds theorem states that # The odds strategy is optimal, that is, it maximizes the probability of stopping on the last 1. # The win probability of the odds strategy equals w= Q_s R_s # If R_s \\ge 1, the win probability w is always at least , and this lower bound is best possible. ==Features== The odds algorithm computes the optimal strategy and the optimal win probability at the same time. Also, the number of operations of the odds algorithm is (sub)linear in n. Hence no quicker algorithm can possibly exist for all sequences, so that the odds algorithm is, at the same time, optimal as an algorithm. ==Sources== devised the odds algorithm, and coined its name.

Given an input string `S = ^BANANA|` (step 1 in the table below), rotate it N times (step 2), where `N = 8` is the length of the `S` string considering also the symbol `^` representing the start of the string and the red | character representing the 'EOF' pointer; these rotations, or circular shifts, are then sorted lexicographically (step 3). The output of the encoding phase is the last column `L = BNN^AA|A` after step 3, and the index (0-based) `I` of the row containing the original string `S`, in this case `I = 6`. Transformation 1\\.

Increasing the size of the alphabet (by appending the EOF character) makes later compression steps awkward. There is a bijective version of the transform, by which the transformed string uniquely identifies the original, and the two have the same length and contain exactly the same characters, just in a different order.. The bijective transform is computed by factoring the input into a non-increasing sequence of Lyndon words; such a factorization exists and is unique by the Chen–Fox–Lyndon theorem,* and may be found in linear time.. The algorithm sorts the rotations of all the words; as in the Burrows–Wheeler transform, this produces a sorted sequence of n strings. The transformed string is then obtained by picking the final character of each string in this sorted list. The one important caveat here is that strings of different lengths are not ordered in the usual way; the two strings are repeated forever, and the infinite repeats are sorted. For example, \"ORO\" precedes \"OR\" because \"OROORO...\" precedes \"OROROR...\". For example, the text \"^BANANA|\" is transformed into \"ANNBAA^|\" through these steps (the red | character indicates the EOF pointer) in the original string. The EOF character is unneeded in the bijective transform, so it is dropped during the transform and re-added to its proper place in the file. The string is broken into Lyndon words so the words in the sequence are decreasing using the comparison method above. (Note that we're sorting '^' as succeeding other characters.) \"^BANANA\" becomes (^) (B) (AN) (AN) (A).\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Burrows–Wheeler transform\nContent: represented by a single pointer into the strings, and the sort performed using the indices. In the decoder, there is also no need to store the table, and in fact no sort is needed at all. In time proportional to the alphabet size and string length, the decoded string may be generated one character at a time from right to left. A \"character\" in the algorithm can be a byte, or a bit, or any other convenient size. One may also make the observation that mathematically, the encoded string can be computed as a simple modification of the suffix array, and suffix arrays can be computed with linear time and memory. The BWT can be defined with regards to the suffix array SA of text T as (1-based indexing): BWT[i] = \\begin{cases} T[SA[i]-1], & \\text{if }SA[i] > 0\\\\\\ \\$, & \\text{otherwise}\\end{cases} There is no need to have an actual 'EOF' character. Instead, a pointer can be used that remembers where in a string the 'EOF' would be if it existed. In this approach, the output of the BWT must include both the transformed string, and the final value of the pointer. The inverse transform then shrinks it back down to the original size: it is given a string and a pointer, and returns just a string. A complete description of the algorithms can be found in Burrows and Wheeler's paper, or in a number of online sources. The algorithms vary somewhat by whether EOF is used, and in which direction the sorting was done. In fact, the original formulation did not use an EOF marker. ==Bijective variant== Since any rotation of the input string will lead to the same transformed string, the BWT cannot be inverted without adding\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Lexicographically minimal string rotation\nContent: implement. def least_rotation(s: str) -> int: \"\"\"Booth's lexicographically minimal string rotation algorithm.\"\"\" n = len(s) f = [-1] * (2 * n) k = 0 for j in range(1, 2 * n): i = f[j - k - 1] while i != -1 and s[j % n] != s[(k + i + 1) % n]: if s[j % n] < s[(k + i + 1) % n]: k = j - i - 1 i = f[i] if i == -1 and s[j % n] != s[(k + i + 1) % n]: if s[j % n] < s[(k + i + 1) % n]: k = j f[j - k] = -1 else: f[j - k] = i + 1 return k Of interest is that removing all lines of code which modify the value of results in the original Knuth-Morris-Pratt preprocessing function, as (representing the rotation) will remain zero. Booth's algorithm runs in time, where is the length of the string. The algorithm performs at most comparisons in the worst case, and requires auxiliary memory of length to hold the failure function table. ===Shiloach's Fast Canonization Algorithm=== Shiloach (1981) proposed an algorithm improving on Booth's result in terms of performance. It was observed that if there are q equivalent lexicographically minimal rotations of a string of length n, then the string must consist of q equal substrings of length d=n/q. The algorithm requires only n + d/2 comparisons and constant space in the worst case. The algorithm is divided into two phases. The first phase is a quick sieve which rules out indices that are obviously not starting locations for the lexicographically minimal rotation. The\n\nID: 4\nTitle: String (computer science)\nContent: the empty string. === Prefixes and suffixes === A string s is said to be a prefix of t if there exists a string u such that t = su. If u is nonempty, s is said to be a proper prefix of t. Symmetrically, a string s is said to be a suffix of t if there exists a string u such that t = us. If u is nonempty, s is said to be a proper suffix of t. Suffixes and prefixes are substrings of t. Both the relations \"is a prefix of\" and \"is a suffix of\" are prefix orders. === Reversal === The reverse of a string is a string with the same symbols but in reverse order. For example, if s = abc (where a, b, and c are symbols of the alphabet), then the reverse of s is cba. A string that is the reverse of itself (e.g., s = madam) is called a palindrome, which also includes the empty string and all strings of length 1. === Rotations === A string s = uv is said to be a rotation of t if t = vu. For example, if Σ = {0, 1} the string 0011001 is a rotation of 0100110, where u = 00110 and v = 01. As another example, the string abc has three different rotations, viz. abc itself (with u=abc, v=ε), bca (with u=bc, v=a), and cab (with u=c, v=ab). === Lexicographical ordering === It is often useful to define an ordering on a set of strings. If the alphabet Σ has a total order (cf. alphabetical order) one can define a total order on Σ* called lexicographical order. For example, if\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Gestalt pattern matching\nContent: : \\frac{2K_m}{|S_1|+|S_2|} = \\frac{2 \\cdot (|\\text{WIKIM}|+|\\text{IA}|)}{|S_1|+|S_2|} = \\frac{2 \\cdot (5 + 2)}{9 + 9} = \\frac{14}{18} = 0.\\overline{7} == Properties == The Ratcliff/Obershelp matching characters can be substantially different from each longest common subsequence of the given strings.

However, the longest common subsequence of S_1 and S_2 is (ddd) \\; (bbbb) \\; (eee), with a total length of 10. === Complexity === The execution time of the algorithm is O(n^3) in a worst case and O(n^2) in an average case. By changing the computing method, the execution time can be improved significantly. === Commutative property === The Python library implementation of the gestalt pattern matching algorithm is not commutative:How does Pythons SequenceMatcher work? at stackoverflow.com : D_{ro}(S_1, S_2) eq D_{ro}(S_2, S_1). ;Sample For the two strings : S_1 = \\text{GESTALT PATTERN MATCHING} and : S_2 = \\text{GESTALT PRACTICE} the metric result for :D_{ro}(S_1, S_2) is \\frac{24}{40} with the substrings `GESTALT P`, `A`, `T`, `E` and for : D_{ro}(S_2, S_1) the metric is \\frac{26}{40} with the substrings `GESTALT P`, `R`, `A`, `C`, `I`. == Applications == The Python `difflib`\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Lexicographically minimal string rotation\nContent: text: In computer science, the lexicographically minimal string rotation or lexicographically least circular substring is the problem of finding the rotation of a string possessing the lowest lexicographical order of all such rotations. For example, the lexicographically minimal rotation of \"bbaaccaadd\" would be \"aaccaaddbb\". It is possible for a string to have multiple lexicographically minimal rotations, but for most applications this does not matter as the rotations must be equivalent. Finding the lexicographically minimal rotation is useful as a way of normalizing strings. If the strings represent potentially isomorphic structures such as graphs, normalizing in this way allows for simple equality checking. A common implementation trick when dealing with circular strings is to concatenate the string to itself instead of having to perform modular arithmetic on the string indices. ==Algorithms== ===The Naive Algorithm=== The naive algorithm for finding the lexicographically minimal rotation of a string is to iterate through successive rotations while keeping track of the most lexicographically minimal rotation encountered. If the string is of length , this algorithm runs in time in the worst case. ===Booth's Algorithm=== An efficient algorithm was proposed by Booth (1980). The algorithm uses a modified preprocessing function from the Knuth-Morris-Pratt string search algorithm. The failure function for the string is computed as normal, but the string is rotated during the computation so some indices must be computed more than once as they wrap around. Once all indices of the failure function have been successfully computed without the string rotating again, the minimal lexicographical rotation is known to be found and its starting index is returned. The correctness of the algorithm is somewhat difficult to understand, but it is easy to implement. def least_rotation(s: str) -> int: \"\"\"Booth's\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Tree rotation\nContent: Q's left-child's parent to P] Set Q's left child to be P. [Set P's parent to Q] All other connections are left as-is. There are also double rotations, which are combinations of left and right rotations. A double left rotation at X can be defined to be a right rotation at the right child of X followed by a left rotation at X; similarly, a double right rotation at X can be defined to be a left rotation at the left child of X followed by a right rotation at X. Tree rotations are used in a number of tree data structures such as AVL trees, red–black trees, WAVL trees, splay trees, and treaps. They require only constant time because they are local transformations: they only operate on 5 nodes, and need not examine the rest of the tree. ==Rotations for rebalancing== thumb|Pictorial description of how rotations cause rebalancing in an AVL tree. A tree can be rebalanced using rotations. After a rotation, the side of the rotation increases its height by 1 whilst the side opposite the rotation decreases its height similarly. Therefore, one can strategically apply rotations to nodes whose left child and right child differ in height by more than 1. Self-balancing binary search trees apply this operation automatically. A type of tree which uses this rebalancing technique is the AVL tree. ==Rotation distance== The rotation distance between any two binary trees with the same number of nodes is the minimum number of rotations needed to transform one into the other. With this distance, the set of n-node binary trees becomes a metric space: the distance is symmetric, positive when given two different trees, and satisfies the triangle inequality.

Thus, for example doubling the length-4 permutation gives , adding one gives , and concatenating these two sequences gives the length-8 permutation . ==Generalizations== The generalization to radix b representations, for b > 2, and to n=b^k, is a digit-reversal permutation, in which the base-b digits of the index of each element are reversed to obtain the permuted index. The same idea can also been generalized to mixed radix number systems. In such cases, the digit-reversal permutation should simultaneously reverses the digits of each item and the bases of the number system, so that each reversed digit remains within the range defined by its base. Permutations that generalize the bit-reversal permutation by reversing contiguous blocks of bits within the binary representations of their indices can be used to interleave two equal-length sequences of data in-place.. There are two extensions of the bit-reversal permutation to sequences of arbitrary length. These extensions coincide with bit-reversal for sequences whose length is a power of 2, and their purpose is to separate adjacent items in a sequence for the efficient operation of the Kaczmarz algorithm. The first of these extensions, called efficient ordering, operates on composite numbers, and it is based on decomposing the number into its prime components. The second extension, called EBR (extended bit-reversal), is similar in spirit to bit- reversal. Given an array of size n, EBR fills the array with a permutation of the numbers in the range\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Misra–Gries heavy hitters algorithm\nContent: text: Misra and Gries defined the heavy-hitters problem (though they did not introduce the term heavy-hitters) and described the first algorithm for it in the paper Finding repeated elements. Their algorithm extends the Boyer-Moore majority finding algorithm in a significant way. One version of the heavy- hitters problem is as follows: Given is a bag of elements and an integer . Find the values that occur more than times in . The Misra-Gries algorithm solves the problem by making two passes over the values in , while storing at most values from and their number of occurrences during the course of the algorithm. Misra-Gries is one of the earliest streaming algorithms, and it is described below in those terms in section #Summaries. ==Misra–Gries algorithm== A bag is a like a set in which the same value may occur multiple times.

These numbers count the number of partitions of the integers in the range [1,r+n] into r+k non-empty subsets such that the first r integers belong to distinct subsets. Partitions of this type can be placed into a bijective equivalence with the parameter words, by creating a word with a character for each of the n integers in the range [r+1,n+r], setting this character value to be either an integer in [1,r] belonging to the same subset of the partition, or a wildcard character for each subset of the partition that does not contain an integer in [1,r]. The r-Stirling numbers obey a simple recurrence relation by which they may easily be calculated. ==Applications== In Ramsey theory, parameter words and combinatorial cubes may be used to formulate the Graham–Rothschild theorem, according to which, for every finite alphabet and group action, and every combination of integer values m, k, and r, there exists a sufficiently large number n such that if each combinatorial cube over strings of length n is assigned one of r colors, then there exists a combinatorial cube all of whose subcubes have the same color. This result is a key foundation for structural Ramsey theory, and is used to define Graham's number, an enormous number used to estimate the value of n for a certain combination of values.

Compared to array-based implementation, this implementation method has superior space complexity of O(m\\cdot n). ==Enumeration of m-ary trees== Listing all possible m-ary trees is useful in many disciplines as a way of checking hypotheses or theories. Proper representation of m-ary tree objects can greatly simplify the generation process. One can construct a bit sequence representation using the depth-first search of a m-ary tree with n nodes indicating the presence of a node at a given index using binary values. For example, the bit sequence x=1110000100010001000 is representing a 3-ary tree with n=6 nodes as shown below. center|3-ary tree with bit sequence of 1110000100010001000 and Simple Zero Sequence of 004433 The problem with this representation is that listing all bit strings in lexicographic order would mean two successive strings might represent two trees that are lexicographically very different. Therefore, enumeration over binary strings would not necessarily result in an ordered generation of all m-ary trees. A better representation is based on an integer string that indicates the number of zeroes between successive ones, known as Simple Zero Sequence.

Their algorithm extends the Boyer-Moore majority finding algorithm in a significant way. One version of the heavy- hitters problem is as follows: Given is a bag of elements and an integer . Find the values that occur more than times in . The Misra-Gries algorithm solves the problem by making two passes over the values in , while storing at most values from and their number of occurrences during the course of the algorithm. Misra-Gries is one of the earliest streaming algorithms, and it is described below in those terms in section #Summaries. ==Misra–Gries algorithm== A bag is a like a set in which the same value may occur multiple times. Assume that a bag is available as an array of elements. In the abstract description of the algorithm, we treat and its segments also as bags. Henceforth, a heavy hitter of bag is a value that occurs more than times in it, for some integer , . A -reduced bag for bag is derived from by repeating the following operation until no longer possible: Delete distinct elements from . From its definition, a -reduced bag contains fewer than different values. The following theorem is easy to prove: Theorem 1. Each heavy-hitter of is an element of a -reduced bag for . The first pass of the heavy-hitters computation constructs a -reduced bag . The second pass declares an element of to be a heavy-hitter if it occurs more than times in .

It is simple to swap two non-overlapping regions of an array of equal size. However, it is not simple to swap two non-overlapping regions of an array in-place that are next to each other, but are of unequal sizes (such swapping is equivalent to Array Rotation). Three algorithms are known to accomplish this: Bentley's Juggling (also known as Dolphin Algorithm D. Gries, H. Mills (1981), Swapping Sections), Gries-Mills, and Reversal.Jon Bentley, \"Programming Pearls\", pp. 13–15, 209-211. All three algorithms are linear time O(n), (see Time complexity). ==Reversal algorithm== The reversal algorithm is the simplest to explain, using rotations. A rotation is an in-place reversal of array elements. This method swaps two elements of an array from outside in within a range. The rotation works for an even or odd number of array elements. The reversal algorithm uses three in-place rotations to accomplish an in-place block swap: * Rotate region A * Rotate region B * Rotate region AB Gries-Mills and Reversal algorithms perform better than Bentley's Juggling, because of their cache-friendly memory access pattern behavior. The Reversal algorithm parallelizes well, because rotations can be split into sub-regions, which can be rotated independently of others. ==References== Category:Algorithms Category:Arrays Category:Sorting algorithms\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Nial\nContent: 9 5 b := 3 2 reshape Arr |5 6 |7 8 |9 5 inner[+,*] b |130 113 |148 145 === Computing an average === Definitions are of the form '<name> is <expression>' average is / [sum, tally] average Arr |7. === Computing a factorial === fact is recur [ 0 =, 1 first, pass, product, -1 +] fact 4 |24 === Reversing an array === rev is reshape [ shape, across [pass, pass, converse append ] ] rev [1, 2, 3, 4] |4 3 2 1 === Generating primes === Contrast with APL primes is sublist [ each (2 = sum eachright (0 = mod) [pass,count]), pass ] rest count primes 10 |2 3 5 7 ==== Explanation ==== Checking the divisibility of A by B is_divisible is 0 = mod [A,B] Defining is_prime filter is_prime is 2 = sum eachright is_divisible [pass,count] Count generates an array [1..N] and pass is N (identity operation). eachright applies is_divisible (pass, element) in each element of count-generated array.

On average, assuming that each element is equally likely to be searched, binary search makes \\lfloor \\log_2 (n) \\rfloor + 1 - (2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 (n) \\rfloor + 1} - \\lfloor \\log_2 (n) \\rfloor - 2)/n iterations when the target element is in the array. This is approximately equal to \\log_2(n) - 1 iterations. When the target element is not in the array, binary search makes \\lfloor \\log_2 (n) \\rfloor + 2 - 2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 (n) \\rfloor + 1}/(n + 1) iterations on average, assuming that the range between and outside elements is equally likely to be searched. In the best case, where the target value is the middle element of the array, its position is returned after one iteration. In terms of iterations, no search algorithm that works only by comparing elements can exhibit better average and worst-case performance than binary search. The comparison tree representing binary search has the fewest levels possible as every level above the lowest level of the tree is filled completely. Otherwise, the search algorithm can eliminate few elements in an iteration, increasing the number of iterations required in the average and worst case. This is the case for other search algorithms based on comparisons, as while they may work faster on some target values, the average performance over all elements is worse than binary search. By dividing the array in half, binary search ensures that the size of both subarrays are as similar as possible. === Space complexity === Binary search requires three pointers to elements, which\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Bit-reversal permutation\nContent: 0 8 4 12 2 10 6 14 1 9 5 13 3 11 7 15 Each permutation in this sequence can be generated by concatenating two sequences of numbers: the previous permutation, with its values doubled, and the same sequence with each value increased by one. Thus, for example doubling the length-4 permutation gives , adding one gives , and concatenating these two sequences gives the length-8 permutation . ==Generalizations== The generalization to radix b representations, for b > 2, and to n=b^k, is a digit-reversal permutation, in which the base-b digits of the index of each element are reversed to obtain the permuted index. The same idea can also been generalized to mixed radix number systems. In such cases, the digit-reversal permutation should simultaneously reverses the digits of each item and the bases of the number system, so that each reversed digit remains within the range defined by its base. Permutations that generalize the bit-reversal permutation by reversing contiguous blocks of bits within the binary representations of their indices can be used to interleave two equal-length sequences of data in-place.. There are two extensions of the bit-reversal permutation to sequences of arbitrary length. These extensions coincide with bit-reversal for sequences whose length is a power of 2, and their purpose is to separate adjacent items in a sequence for the efficient operation of the Kaczmarz algorithm. The first of these extensions, called efficient ordering, operates on composite numbers, and it is based on decomposing the number into its prime components. The second extension, called EBR (extended bit-reversal), is similar in spirit to bit- reversal. Given an array of size n, EBR fills the array with a permutation of the numbers in the range\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Tennenbaum's theorem\nContent: the choice of A and B this means S is nonrecursive. Now, to prove Tennenbaum's theorem, begin with a nonstandard countable model M and an element a in M so that S = \\mathbb{N} \\cap S_a is nonrecursive. The proof method shows that, because of the way the standard system is defined, it is possible to compute the characteristic function of the set S using the addition function \\oplus of M as an oracle. In particular, if n_0 is the element of M corresponding to 0, and n_1 is the element of M corresponding to 1, then for each i \\in \\mathbb{N} we can compute n_i = n_1 \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus n_1 (i times). To decide if a number n is in S, first compute p, the nth prime in \\mathbb{N}. Then, search for an element y of M so that :a = \\underbrace{y \\oplus y \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus y}_{p \\text{ times}} \\oplus n_i for some i < p. This search will halt because the Euclidean algorithm can be applied to any model of PA. Finally, we have n \\in S if and only if the i found in the search was 0. Because S is not recursive, this means that the addition operation on M is nonrecursive. A similar argument shows that it is possible to compute the characteristic function of S using the multiplication of M as an oracle, so the multiplication operation on M is also nonrecursive (Kaye 1991:154). ==References== * * * * Category:Model theory Category:Theorems in the foundations of mathematics\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Maximal pair\nContent: two inequalities are the condition for being maximal).

Binary search trees are also efficacious in sortings and search algorithms. However, the search complexity of a BST depends upon the order in which the nodes are inserted and deleted; since in worst case, successive operations in the binary search tree may lead to degeneracy and form a singly linked list (or \"unbalanced tree\") like structure, thus has the same worst- case complexity as a linked list. Binary search trees are also a fundamental data structure used in construction of abstract data structures such as sets, multisets, and associative arrays. ==Operations== ===Searching=== Searching in a binary search tree for a specific key can be programmed recursively or iteratively. Searching begins by examining the root node. If the tree is , the key being searched for does not exist in the tree. Otherwise, if the key equals that of the root, the search is successful and the node is returned. If the key is less than that of the root, the search proceeds by examining the left subtree. Similarly, if the key is greater than that of the root, the search proceeds by examining the right subtree. This process is repeated until the key is found or the remaining subtree is \\text{nil}. If the searched key is not found after a \\text{nil} subtree is reached, then the key is not present in the tree. ====Recursive search==== The following pseudocode implements the BST search procedure through recursion.

The leaves are not drawn. In computer science, a binary search tree (BST), also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree data structure with the key of each internal node being greater than all the keys in the respective node's left subtree and less than the ones in its right subtree. The time complexity of operations on the binary search tree is directly proportional to the height of the tree. Binary search trees allow binary search for fast lookup, addition, and removal of data items. Since the nodes in a BST are laid out so that each comparison skips about half of the remaining tree, the lookup performance is proportional to that of binary logarithm. BSTs were devised in the 1960s for the problem of efficient storage of labeled data and are attributed to Conway Berners-Lee and David Wheeler. The performance of a binary search tree is dependent on the order of insertion of the nodes into the tree since arbitrary insertions may lead to degeneracy; several variations of the binary search tree can be built with guaranteed worst-case performance. The basic operations include: search, traversal, insert and delete. BSTs with guaranteed worst-case complexities perform better than an unsorted array, which would require linear search time. The complexity analysis of BST shows that, on average, the insert, delete and search takes O(\\log n) for n nodes. In the worst case, they degrade to that of a singly linked list: O(n). To address the boundless increase of the tree height with arbitrary insertions and deletions, self-balancing variants of BSTs are introduced to bound the worst lookup\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Binary search algorithm\nContent: graphs === Binary search has been generalized to work on certain types of graphs, where the target value is stored in a vertex instead of an array element. Binary search trees are one such generalization--when a vertex (node) in the tree is queried, the algorithm either learns that the vertex is the target, or otherwise which subtree the target would be located in. However, this can be further generalized as follows: given an undirected, positively weighted graph and a target vertex, the algorithm learns upon querying a vertex that it is equal to the target, or it is given an incident edge that is on the shortest path from the queried vertex to the target. The standard binary search algorithm is simply the case where the graph is a path. Similarly, binary search trees are the case where the edges to the left or right subtrees are given when the queried vertex is unequal to the target. For all undirected, positively weighted graphs, there is an algorithm that finds the target vertex in O(\\log n) queries in the worst case. === Noisy binary search === thumb|right|In noisy binary search, there is a certain probability that a comparison is incorrect. Noisy binary search algorithms solve the case where the algorithm cannot reliably compare elements of the array.

Optimal BSTs are generally divided into two types: static and dynamic. In the static optimality problem, the tree cannot be modified after it has been constructed. In this case, there exists some particular layout of the nodes of the tree which provides the smallest expected search time for the given access probabilities. Various algorithms exist to construct or approximate the statically optimal tree given the information on the access probabilities of the elements. In the dynamic optimality problem, the tree can be modified at any time, typically by permitting tree rotations. The tree is considered to have a cursor starting at the root which it can move or use to perform modifications. In this case, there exists some minimal-cost sequence of these operations which causes the cursor to visit every node in the target access sequence in order. The splay tree is conjectured to have a constant competitive ratio compared to the dynamically optimal tree in all cases, though this has not yet been proven. == Static optimality == === Definition === In the static optimality problem as defined by Knuth, we are given a set of ordered elements and a set of 2n+1 probabilities. We will denote the elements a_1 through a_n and the probabilities A_1 through A_n and B_0 through B_n. A_i is the probability of a search being done for element a_i (or successful search).

One useful operation on such a tree is traversal: visiting all the items in order of the key. A simple recursive traversal algorithm that visits each node of a binary search tree is the following. Assume is a pointer to a node, or . \"Visiting\" can mean performing any action on the node or its contents. Algorithm traverse(): * Input: a pointer to a node (or ) * If , return. * Else: ** traverse(left-child()) ** Visit ** traverse(right-child()) One problem with this algorithm is that, because of its recursion, it uses stack space proportional to the height of a tree. If the tree is fairly balanced, this amounts to space for a tree containing elements. In the worst case, when the tree takes the form of a chain, the height of the tree is so the algorithm takes space. A second problem is that all traversals must begin at the root when nodes have pointers only to their children. It is common to have a pointer to a particular node, but that is not sufficient to get back to the rest of the tree unless extra information is added, such as thread pointers. In this approach, it may not be possible to tell whether the left and/or right pointers in a given node actually point to children, or are a consequence of threading. If the distinction is necessary, adding a single bit to each node is enough to record it. In a 1968 textbook, Donald Knuth asked whether\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Binary tree\nContent: When the breadth-index is masked at bit d − 1, the bit values and mean to step either left or right, respectively.

Individual deal spreads can widen to more than fifty percent in broken deals. The HFRI Merger Arbitrage Index posted a maximum one-month loss of -6.5% but a maximum one-month gain of only 2.9% from 1990 to 2005. Merger arbitrage is significantly constrained by transaction costs. Arbitrageurs could generate abnormally high returns using this strategy, but the frequency and high cost of trades negate much of the profits. == Example == Suppose Company A is trading at $40 a share. Then Company X announces a plan to buy Company A, in which case holders of Company A's stock get $80 in cash. Then Company A's stock jumps to $70. It does not go to $80 since there is some chance the deal will not go through. In this case, the arbitrageur can purchase shares of Company A's stock for $70. He will gain $10 if the deal is completed and lose $30 if the deal is terminated (assuming the stock returns to its original $40 in a break, which may not occur). According to the market, the probability that the deal is consummated at its original terms is 75% and the probability that the deal will be terminated is 25%. The arbitrageur has three choices: # Purchase Company A's stock at $70. They would do this if he believes the probability that the deal will close is higher than or in-line with the odds offered by the market. # Short sell Company A's stock at $70. They would do this if he believes the probability that the deal will be terminated is higher than the odds offered by the market.

Ideally, we would like R to be the maximum revenue that can be extracted from the market. However, we do not know this maximum revenue in advance. We can try to estimate it using one of the following ways: 1\\. Random sampling: ::randomly partition the bidders to two groups, such that each bidder has a chance of 1/2 to go to each group. Let R1 be the maximum revenue in group 1 and R2 the maximum revenue in group 2. Run R1-profit-extractor in group 2, and R2-profit-extractor in group 1. This mechanism guarantees a profit of at least 1/4 the maximum profit. A variant of this mechanism partitions the agents to three groups instead of two, and attains at least 1/3.25 of the maximum profit. 2\\. Consensus estimate: ::Calculate the maximum revenue in the entire population; apply a certain random rounding process that guarantees that the calculation is truthful with-high-probability. Let R be the estimated revenue; run R-profit-extractor in the entire population. This mechanism guarantees a profit of at least 1/3.39 the maximum profit, in a digital goods auction. == Profit extraction in a double auction == The profit- extraction idea can be generalized to arbitrary single-parameter utility agents. In particular, it can be used in a double auction where several sellers sell a single unit of some item (with different costs) and several buyers want at most a single unit of that item (with different valuations).

The left-hand side of this expression, R'(L), is the marginal revenue product of labour (roughly, the extra revenue generated by an extra worker) and is represented by the red MRP curve in the diagram. The right-hand side is the marginal cost of labour (roughly, the extra cost due to an extra worker) and is represented by the green MC curve in the diagram. Notably, the marginal cost is higher than the wage w(L) paid to the new worker by the amount :w'(L)L\\,\\\\!. This is because, by assumption, the firm has to increase the wage paid to all the workers it already employs whenever it hires an extra worker. In the diagram, this leads to an MC curve that is above the labour supply curve S. The first-order condition for maximum profit is then satisfied at point A of the diagram, where the MC and MRP curves intersect. This determines the profit-maximizing employment as L on the horizontal axis. The corresponding wage w is then obtained from the supply curve, through point M. The monopsonistic equilibrium at M can be contrasted with the equilibrium that would obtain under competitive conditions. Suppose a competitive employer entered the market and offered a wage higher than that at M. Then every employee of the first employer would choose instead to work for the competitor. Moreover, the competitor would gain all the former profits of the first employer, minus a less-than-offsetting amount\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Box spread\nContent: so that all that remains at the end is a balance whose value B will be known for certain at the beginning of the sequence. If there were no transaction costs then a non-zero value for B would allow an arbitrageur to profit by following the sequence either as it stands if the present value of B is positive, or with all transactions reversed if the present value of B is negative. However, market forces tend to close any arbitrage windows which might open; hence the present value of B is usually insufficiently different from zero for transaction costs to be covered. This is considered typically to be a \"Market Maker/ Floor trader\" strategy only, due to extreme commission costs of the multiple-leg spread. If the box is for example 20 dollars as per lower example getting short the box anything under 20 is profit and long anything over, has hedged all risk . A present value of zero for B leads to a parity relation. Two well-known parity relations are: *Spot futures parity: The current price of a stock equals the current price of a futures contract discounted by the time remaining until settlement: S = F e^{-rT} *Put call parity: A long European call c together with a short European put p at the same strike price K is equivalent to borrowing K e^{-rT} and buying the stock at price S. In other words, we can combine options with cash to construct a synthetic stock: c - p = S - K e^{-rT} Note that directly exploiting deviations from either of these two parity relations involves purchasing or selling the underlying stock. ==The box spread== Now consider the put/call parity equation at two different strike prices K_1 and K_2.

The third person on the list likewise needs 27 additional signups: seven for the person on top of the list, 10 for the person directly above him, and then 10 for himself. The number of people required continues to grow for each new person joining the list. For the 10th person to cycle a total of 100 people would have to sign up, 1000 for the 100th, and so on. Through this process, the matrix scheme generates substantial profit for its organiser. At the time of its popularity, for example, a PlayStation 2 cost a maximum of $299. After selling 10 $50 e-books, the organiser could make $500, and could purchase a PS2 for $299 to send to the first bidder while retaining a $201 profit. This same process could be repeated every time the matrix cycles; if the matrix cycled 10 times, the organiser would have sold $5000 worth of e-books, of which $2990 would have been spent on 10 PS2s, leaving them with a profit of $2010. ==In queueing theory== A matrix scheme is easily represented as a simple M/M/1 queue within the context of queueing theory. In such a system there is a Markovian arrival, Markovian service, and one single server.F. S. Hiller and G. J. Lieberman. Introduction to Operations Research. McGraw-Hill, New York, 1995 In the standard matrix queue, service rates are a function of arrival rates since the time to cycle out of the queue is based on the entry fee into the matrix from arriving members. Also, since members move through the matrix in single file, it is easy to associate the single server. The basic premise of queueing theory is that when arrival rates equal or exceed service rates, overall\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Find the maximum profit that can be earned from a given sequence of transactions? arr = [100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695]\n\n[/INST]IDs: </s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

If required, the interest on additional non-recurring and recurring deposits can also be defined within the same formula (see below). * P = principal deposit * r = rate of return (monthly) * M = monthly deposit, and * t = time, in months The compound interest for each deposit is: M'=M(1+r)^{t} and adding all recurring deposits over the total period t (i starts at 0 if deposits begin with the investment of principal; i starts at 1 if deposits begin the next month) : M'=\\sum^{t-1}_{i=0}{M(1+r)^{t-i}} recognizing the geometric series: M'=M\\sum^{t-1}_{i=0}(1+r)^{t}\\frac{1}{(1+r)^{i}} and applying the closed-form formula (common ratio :1/(1+r)) we obtain: P' = M\\frac{(1+r)^{t}-1}{r}+P(1+r)^t If two or more types of deposits occur (either recurring or non-recurring), the compound value earned can be represented as \\text{Value}=M\\frac{(1+r)^{t}-1}{r}+P(1+r)^t+k\\frac{(1+r)^{t-x}-1}{r}+C(1+r)^{t-y} where C is each lump sum and k are non-monthly recurring deposits, respectively, and x and y are the differences in time between a new deposit and the total period t is modeling. A practical estimate for reverse calculation of the rate of return when the exact date and amount of each recurring deposit is not known, a formula that assumes a uniform recurring monthly deposit over the period, is:http://moneychimp.com/features/portfolio_performance_calculator.htm \"recommended by The Four Pillars of Investing and The Motley\n\nID: 1\nTitle: Rule of 72\nContent: if you were to invest $100 with compounding interest at a rate of 9% per annum, the rule of 72 gives 72/9 = 8 years required for the investment to be worth $200; an exact calculation gives ln(2)/ln(1+0.09) = 8.0432 years. Similarly, to determine the time it takes for the value of money to halve at a given rate, divide the rule quantity by that rate. *To determine the time for money's buying power to halve, financiers divide the rule-quantity by the inflation rate. Thus at 3.5% inflation using the rule of 70, it should take approximately 70/3.5 = 20 years for the value of a unit of currency to halve.Donella Meadows, Thinking in Systems: A Primer, Chelsea Green Publishing, 2008, page 33 (box \"Hint on reinforcing feedback loops and doubling time\"). *To estimate the impact of additional fees on financial policies (e.g., mutual fund fees and expenses, loading and expense charges on variable universal life insurance investment portfolios), divide 72 by the fee. For example, if the Universal Life policy charges an annual 3% fee over and above the cost of the underlying investment fund, then the total account value will be cut to 50% in 72 / 3 = 24 years, and then to 25% of the value in 48 years, compared to holding exactly the same investment outside the policy. == Choice of rule == The value 72 is a convenient choice of numerator, since it has many small divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 12. It provides a good approximation for annual compounding, and for compounding at typical rates (from 6% to 10%); the approximations are less accurate at higher interest rates.

To compare the change in purchasing power, the real interest rate (nominal interest rate minus inflation rate) should be used. The operation of evaluating a present value into the future value is called a capitalization (how much will $100 today be worth in 5 years?). The reverse operation—evaluating the present value of a future amount of money—is called a discounting (how much will $100 received in 5 years—at a lottery for example—be worth today?). It follows that if one has to choose between receiving $100 today and $100 in one year, the rational decision is to choose the $100 today. If the money is to be received in one year and assuming the savings account interest rate is 5%, the person has to be offered at least $105 in one year so that the two options are equivalent (either receiving $100 today or receiving $105 in one year). This is because if $100 is deposited in a savings account, the value will be $105 after one year, again assuming no risk of losing the initial amount through bank default. ==Interest rates== Interest is the additional amount of money gained between the beginning and the end of a time period. Interest represents the time value of money, and can be thought of as rent that is required of a borrower in order to use money from a lender. For example, when an individual takes out a bank loan, the individual is charged interest. Alternatively, when an individual deposits money into a bank, the money earns interest. In this case, the bank is the borrower of the funds and is responsible for crediting interest to the account holder. Similarly,\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Compound interest\nContent: the interest is applied (expressed using the same time units as r, usually years). The total compound interest generated is the final value minus the initial principal: I=P\\left(1+\\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}-P ====Example 1==== Suppose a principal amount of $1,500 is deposited in a bank paying an annual interest rate of 4.3%, compounded quarterly. Then the balance after 6 years is found by using the formula above, with P = 1500, r = 0.043 (4.3%), n = 4, and t = 6: A=1500\\times\\left(1+\\frac{0.043}{4}\\right)^{4\\times 6}\\approx 1938.84 So the amount A after 6 years is approximately $1,938.84. Subtracting the original principal from this amount gives the amount of interest received: 1938.84-1500=438.84 ====Example 2==== Suppose the same amount of $1,500 is compounded biennially (every 2 years). (This is very unusual in practice.) Then the balance after 6 years is found by using the formula above, with P = 1500, r = 0.043 (4.3%), n = 1/2 (the interest is compounded every two years), and t = 6 : A=1500\\times(1+(0.043\\times 2))^{\\frac{6}{2}}\\approx 1921.24 So, the balance after 6 years is approximately $1,921.24. The amount of interest received can be calculated by subtracting the principal from this amount. 1921.24-1500=421.24 The interest is less compared with the previous case, as a result of the lower compounding frequency. ===Accumulation function=== Since the principal P is simply a coefficient, it is often dropped for simplicity, and the resulting accumulation function is used instead. The accumulation function shows what $1 grows to after any length of time. Accumulation functions for simple and compound interest are a(t)=1 + r t a(t) = \\left(1 + \\frac {r}\n\nID: 4\nTitle: Compound interest\nContent: text: thumb|300px|Effective interest rates thumb|right|310px|The effect of earning 20% annual interest on an initial $1,000 investment at various compounding frequencies Compound interest is the addition of interest to the principal sum of a loan or deposit, or in other words, interest on principal plus interest. It is the result of reinvesting interest, or adding it to the loaned capital rather than paying it out, or requiring payment from borrower, so that interest in the next period is then earned on the principal sum plus previously accumulated interest. Compound interest is standard in finance and economics. Compound interest is contrasted with simple interest, where previously accumulated interest is not added to the principal amount of the current period, so there is no compounding. The simple annual interest rate is the interest amount per period, multiplied by the number of periods per year. The simple annual interest rate is also known as the nominal interest rate (not to be confused with the interest rate not adjusted for inflation, which goes by the same name). ==Compounding frequency== The compounding frequency is the number of times per year (or rarely, another unit of time) the accumulated interest is paid out, or capitalized (credited to the account), on a regular basis. The frequency could be yearly, half-yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, or continuously (or not at all, until maturity). For example, monthly capitalization with interest expressed as an annual rate means that the compounding frequency is 12, with time periods measured in months. The effect of compounding depends on: # The nominal interest rate which is applied and # The frequency interest is compounded. ==Annual equivalent rate== The nominal rate cannot be directly compared between loans with different compounding frequencies. Both the nominal interest rate and\n\nID: 5\nTitle: Effective interest rate\nContent: (subject to regulation) to an annualized rate that does not take into account front-fees and other costs. Annual percentage yield or effective annual yield is the analogous concept for savings or investments, such as a certificate of deposit. Since a loan by a borrower is an investment for the lender, both terms can apply to the same transaction, depending on the point of view. Effective annual interest or yield may be calculated or applied differently depending on circumstances, and the definition should be studied carefully. For example, a bank may compute effective yield on a portfolio of loans after subtracting expected losses and adding income from fees, meaning that the interest paid by each borrower may differ substantially from the bank's effective yield. ==Calculation== The effective interest rate is calculated as if compounded annually. The effective rate is calculated in the following way, where r is the effective annual rate, i the nominal rate, and n the number of compounding periods per year (for example, 12 for monthly compounding): : r \\ = \\ \\left(1+\\frac{i}{n}\\right)^n - 1 For example, a nominal interest rate of 6% compounded monthly is equivalent to an effective interest rate of 6.17%. 6% compounded monthly is credited as 6%/12 = 0.005 every month. After one year, the initial capital is increased by the factor (1 + 0.005)12 ≈ 1.0617. Note that the yield increases with the frequency of compounding. When the frequency of compounding is increased up to infinity (as for many processes in nature) the calculation simplifies to: : r \\ = \\ e^i - 1 where e\\approx 2.72 is Euler's mathematical constant.

Usually the interest on FDs is paid every three months from the date of the deposit (e.g. if FD a/c was opened on 15 Feb, the first interest installment would be paid on 15 May). The interest is credited to the customers' Savings bank account or sent to them by cheque. This is a Simple FD. The customer may choose to have the interest reinvested in the FD account. In this case, the deposit is called the Cumulative FD or compound interest FD. For such deposits, the interest is paid with the invested amount on maturity of the deposit at the end of the term. Although banks can refuse to repay FDs before the expiry of the deposit, they generally don't. This is known as a premature withdrawal. In such cases, interest is paid at the rate applicable at the time of withdrawal. For example, a deposit is made for 5 years at 8% but is withdrawn after 2 years. If the rate applicable on the date of deposit for 2 years is 5 percent, the interest will be paid at 5 percent. Banks can charge a penalty for premature withdrawal. Banks issue a separate receipt for every FD because each deposit is treated as a distinct contract. This receipt is known as the Fixed Deposit Receipt (FDR), which has to be surrendered to the bank at the time of renewal or encashment. Many banks offer the facility of automatic renewal of FDs where the customers do give\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Future value\nContent: the bank's saving account, for example. If one wants to compare their change in purchasing power, then they should use the real interest rate (nominal interest rate minus inflation rate). The operation of evaluating a present value into the future value is called capitalization (how much will $100 today be worth in 5 years?). The reverse operation which consists in evaluating the present value of a future amount of money is called a discounting (how much $100 that will be received in 5 years- at a lottery, for example -are worth today?). It follows that if one has to choose between receiving $100 today and $100 in one year, the rational decision is to cash the $100 today. If the money is to be received in one year and assuming the savings account interest rate is 5%, the person has to be offered at least $105 in one year so that two options are equivalent (either receiving $100 today or receiving $105 in one year). This is because if you have cash of $100 today and deposit in your savings account, you will have $105 in one year. ==Simple interest== To determine future value (FV) using simple interest (i.e., without compounding): :FV = PV(1+rt) where PV is the present value or principal, t is the time in years (or a fraction of year), and r stands for the per annum interest rate. Simple interest is rarely used, as compounding is considered more meaningful . Indeed, the Future Value in this case grows linearly (it's a linear function of the initial investment): it doesn't take into account the fact that the interest earned might be compounded itself and produce further interest (which corresponds to an exponential growth of the initial investment -see\n\n\n</documents>\n\nuser_prompt: Calculate the amount of money in a bank account with an initial $100 deposit and an interest rate of 6%, compounded annually\n\n[/INST]IDs: 0, 3</s>", "<s>[INST] Below is a list of documents.

Web frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications on the World Wide Web. Web frameworks aim to automate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development. For example, many web frameworks provide libraries for database access, templating frameworks, and session management, and they often promote code reuse. Although they often target development of dynamic web sites, they are also applicable to static websites. ==History== As the design of the World Wide Web was not inherently dynamic, early hypertext consisted of hand-coded HTML text files that were published on web servers. Any modifications to published pages needed to be performed by the pages' author. In 1993, the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) standard was introduced for interfacing external applications with web servers, to provide a dynamic web page that reflected user inputs. Original implementations of the CGI interface typically had adverse effects on the server load however, because each request started a separate process. More recent implementations utilize persistent processes amongst other techniques to reduce the footprint in the server's resources and offer a general performance boost. In 1995, fully integrated server/language development environments first emerged and new web- specific languages were introduced, such as ColdFusion, PHP, and Active Server Pages. Although the vast majority of languages for creating dynamic web pages have libraries to help with common tasks, web applications often require specific libraries for particular tasks, such as creating HTML (for example, Jakarta Server Faces).

This limits the things that can be done with web services, Before WSRF, no standard in the Web Services family of specifications explicitly defined how to deal with stateful interactions with remote resources. This does not mean that web services could not be stateful. Where required a web service could read from a database, or use session state by way of cookies or WS-Session. WSRF provides a set of operations that web services can use to implement stateful interaction; web service clients communicate with resource services which allow data to be stored and retrieved. When clients talk to the web service they include the identifier of the specific resource that should be used inside the request, encapsulated within the WS-Addressing endpoint reference. This may be a simple URI address, or it may be complex XML content that helps identify or even fully describe the specific resource in question. Alongside the notion of an explicit resource reference comes a standardized set of web service operations to get/set resource properties. These can be used to read and perhaps write resource state, in a manner somewhat similar to having member variables of an object alongside its methods. The primary beneficiary of such a model are management tools, which can enumerate and view resources, even if they have no other knowledge of them. This is the basis for WSDM. ==Issues with WSRF== WSRF is not without controversy. Most fundamental is architectural: are distributed objects with state and operations the best way to represent remote resources? It is\n\nID: 2\nTitle: Web service\nContent: text: A web service (WS) is either: * a service offered by an electronic device to another electronic device, communicating with each other via the Internet, or * a server running on a computer device, listening for requests at a particular port over a network, serving web documents (HTML, JSON, XML, images). In a web service, a web technology such as HTTP is used for transferring machine-readable file formats such as XML and JSON. In practice, a web service commonly provides an object-oriented web-based interface to a database server, utilized for example by another web server, or by a mobile app, that provides a user interface to the end-user. Many organizations that provide data in formatted HTML pages will also provide that data on their server as XML or JSON, often through a Web service to allow syndication. Another application offered to the end-user may be a mashup, where a Web server consumes several Web services at different machines and compiles the content into one user interface. ==Web services (generic)== ===Asynchronous JavaScript And XML=== Asynchronous JavaScript And XML (AJAX) is a dominant technology for Web services. Developing from the combination of HTTP servers, JavaScript clients and Plain Old XML (as distinct from SOAP and W3C Web Services), now it is frequently used with JSON as well as, or instead of, XML. ===REST=== Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architecture for well- behaved Web services that can function at Internet scale. In a 2004 document, the W3C sets following REST as a key distinguishing feature of Web services: ===Web services that use markup languages=== There are a number of Web services that use markup languages: * JSON-RPC. * JSON-WSP * Representational state transfer (REST) versus\n\nID: 3\nTitle: Web framework\nContent: a client-side JavaScript web framework to organize the code. ====Server-side==== *Apache Wicket *ASP.NET Core *CakePHP *Catalyst *CodeIgniter *CppCMS *Django *Flask *Grails *Jam.py *Laravel *Mojolicious *Ruby on Rails *Sails.js *Symfony *Spring MVC *VIEwoNLY *Wt (web toolkit) *Yii *Zend Framework ====Client-side==== Examples include Backbone.js, AngularJS, Angular, EmberJS, ReactJS, jQuery UI, Svelte, and Vue.js. ===Discussion forums, wikis and weblogs=== *WikiBase/WikiWikiWeb ==Features== Frameworks typically set the control flow of a program and allow the user of the framework to \"hook into\" that flow by exposing various events. This \"inversion of control\" design pattern is considered to be a defining principle of a framework, and benefits the code by enforcing a common flow for a team which everyone can customize in similar ways. For example, some popular \"microframeworks\" such as Ruby's Sinatra (which inspired Express.js) allow for \"middleware\" hooks prior to and after HTTP requests. These middleware functions can be anything, and allow the user to define logging, authentication and session management, and redirecting. ===Web template system=== ===Caching=== Web caching is the caching of web documents in order to reduce bandwidth usage, server load, and perceived \"lag\". A web cache stores copies of documents passing through it; subsequent requests may be satisfied from the cache if certain conditions are met. Some application frameworks provide mechanisms for caching documents and bypassing various stages of the page's preparation, such as database access or template interpretation. ===Security=== Some web frameworks come with authentication and authorization frameworks, that enable the web server to identify the users of the application, and restrict access to functions based on some defined criteria.

Implementation of an SOA requires tools as well as run-time infrastructure software. This is collectively referred to as a service-oriented architecture implementation framework or (SOAIF). The SOAIF envisions a comprehensive framework that provides all the technology that an enterprise might need to build and run an SOA. An SOAIF includes both design-time and run-time capabilities as well as all the software functionality an enterprise needs to build and operate an SOA, including service-oriented: * tools, * management, * integration, * modeling, * security, * processes. As vendors race to provide possible solutions, three different approaches are emerging to integrating disparate, heterogeneous information and systems in the enterprise. These implementation frameworks should meet the requirements for loosely coupled, coarse grained, asynchronous Services. ==Efficiency== Most packaged enterprise applications perform well in streamlining processes related to standard tasks. However, the performance rapidly deteriorates while automating and streamlining customized processes that encompass multiple enterprise applications. The process is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to implement and maintain. The SOAIF infrastructure addresses this issue by allowing the definition of any process in any network topology, spanning multiple enterprise boundaries. This is accomplished via a peer-to-peer messaging infrastructure with distributed security mechanisms that allow efficient data exchanges for easy implementation, while enabling each enterprise to enforce its own security policies. This allows an SOAIF to increase operational efficiency across the entire value chain. SOA works on standard protocols ==Application integration== Existing packaged application integration solutions are complex and require significant implementation effort, often including extensive manual coding for deployment purposes.

Developed on the .NET Framework, CSF enables scalable, loosely coupled service-based solutions. The `session` is the core component of the framework involved in routing messages between participants (participants may be .NET components or web services). Complex Routing can be accomplished by external .NET or BizTalk driver services. CSF is not a replacement for BizTalk; rather, it simplifies orchestrations by removing service specific operations and allowing focus on business/process logic. ==External links== * Connected Services Framework Documentation * Connected Services Framework Developer Center * Connected Services Framework Team Blog Category:.NET Framework software Category:Service-oriented architecture-related products\n\nID: 6\nTitle: WS-CAF\nContent: text: Web Services Composite Application Framework (WS-CAF) is an open framework developed by OASIS. Its purpose is to define a generic and open framework for applications that contain multiple services used together, which are sometimes referred to as composite applications.OASIS Web Services Composite Application Framework (WS-CAF), OASIS, 2006 WS-CAF characteristics include interoperability, ease of implementation and ease of use. == Scope == The scope of WS-CAF includes: * Provision of WSDL definitions for context, coordination and transactions. * Message formats will be specified as SOAP headers and/or body content. * The specification is to be programming language-neutral and platform-neutral. * Demonstrated composability with other Web Service specifications that are being developed as open, recognized standards * The goals of promoting convergence, consistent use, and a coherent architecture. * Support composability as a critical architectural characteristic of Web service specifications.

Most scholarship and literature on the Internet lists ARPANET as the prior network that was iterated on and studied to create it, although other early computer networks and experiments existed alongside or before ARPANET. These histories of the Internet have since been characterized as “teleologies” or “Whig history”; that is, they take the present to be the end point toward which history has been unfolding based on a single cause: In addition to these characteristics, historians have cited methodological problems arising in their work: ==See also== * History of email * History of hypertext * History of telecommunication * Index of Internet- related articles * Internet activism * List of Internet pioneers * MH & xmh: Email for Users & Programmers * Nerds 2.0.1 A Brief History of the Internet * On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog * Outline of the Internet ==References== === Sources === * * * * * * * * ==External links== *Internet History Timeline – Computer History Museum *Histories of the Internet – Internet Society *Hobbes' Internet Timeline 12 *History of the Internet, a short animated film (2009) * Internet Category:Articles containing video clips Category:History of computing Category:Internet governance\n\nID: 1\nTitle: History Commons\nContent: rapidly expanding content. In June 2002, environmental activist Paul Thompson joined CCR, bringing with him a copious amount of research on the September 11 attacks. Thompson eventually used the material he contributed to the website for his 2004 book, The Terror Timeline. Due to the quality of the research, Thompson was invited by Rep. Cynthia McKinney to testify at a Congressional hearing on the failings and flaws of the 9/11 Commission report, and he did so in 2005. Mitchell, Thompson, and other researchers steadily expanded the website's projects and timelines. In 2007, the Center for Grassroots Oversight (CGO) took over operation of the website, renaming it to the History Commons. The current version of the History Commons Web application is written in Java and runs on Apache Tomcat. The data is stored in a MySQL database accessed through JDO.

The History Commons Web application can also create dynamic timelines by clicking on an event summary title or tag, or by searching a keyword or entity name. The History Commons Web application also generates a \"context timeline\" based on a particular event, which shows the summary for that event along with associated summaries describing similar or related events.

The beginning of the modern notion of and current form of the Internet is considered by some to have occurred in late 1990 (though the internet was officially created a few years prior) when Tim Berners-Lee created what is now referred to as HTML code, and created what is generally considered to be the first genuine web page, which marks the origin of the World Wide Web. ==History== ===Origins=== The origins of the Internet date back to the development of packet switching and research commissioned by the United States Department of Defense in the 1960s to enable time-sharing of computers. The primary precursor network, the ARPANET, initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1970s. The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks. The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet,\"#3 1982: the ARPANET community grows\" in 40 maps that explain the internet , Timothy B.

The seven-layer OSI model is still used as a reference for teaching and documentation; however, the OSI protocols originally conceived for the model did not gain popularity. Some engineers argue the OSI reference model is still relevant to cloud computing. Others say the original OSI model doesn't fit today's networking protocols and have suggested instead a simplified approach. Other standards such as X.25 and SNA remain niche players. == Historiography == Janet Abbate's book Inventing the Internet was widely reviewed as an important work in the history of computing and networking, particularly in highlighting the role of social dynamics and of non-American participation in early networking development. The book was also praised for its use of archival resources to tell the history. She has since written about the need for historians to be aware of the perspectives they take in writing about the history of the Internet and explored the implications of defining the Internet in terms of \"technology, use and local experience\" rather than through the lens of the spread of technologies from the United States. Andrew L. Russell argues scholars could and should look differently at the history of the Internet. His work shifts scholarly and popular understanding about the origins of the Internet and contemporary work in Europe that both competed and cooperated with the push for TCP/IP. == See also == * History of the Internet == Notes == == References == === Sources === * * * * * * * * * * == Further reading == * * * * === Primary sources === * == External links == * * Internet Histories: Digital Technology, Culture and Society, Routledge Category:Internet protocols Category:History of the Internet\n\nID: 6\nTitle: Timeline\nContent: timelines, labeled as text * Number timelines, the labels are numbers, commonly line graphs * Interactive, clickable, zoomable * Video timelines There are many methods to visualize timelines. Historically, timelines were static images and were generally drawn or printed on paper. Timelines relied heavily on graphic design, and the ability of the artist to visualize the data. ==Uses== Timelines are often used in education to help students and researchers with understanding the order or chronology of historical events and trends for a subject. To show time on a specific scale on an axis, a timeline can visualize time lapses between events, durations (such as lifetimes or wars), and the simultaneity or the overlap of spans and events. === In historical studies === Timelines are particularly useful for studying history, as they convey a sense of change over time. Wars and social movements are often shown as timelines. Timelines are also useful for biographies. Examples include: * Timeline of the civil rights movement * Timeline of European exploration * Timeline of European imperialism * Timeline of Solar System exploration * Timeline of United States history * Timeline of World War I * Timeline of religion === In natural sciences=== Timelines are also used in the natural world and sciences, such as in astronomy, biology, and geology: *2009 flu pandemic timeline *Chronology of the universe *Geologic time scale *Timeline of evolutionary history of life === In project management=== Another type of timeline is used for project management. Timelines help team members know what milestones need to be achieved and under what time schedule. An example is establishing a project timeline in the implementation phase of the life cycle of a computer system. == Software == Timelines (no longer constrained by previous space and\n\nID: 7\nTitle: Timeline\nContent: text: A timeline is a display of a list of events in chronological order. It is typically a graphic design showing a long bar labelled with dates paralleling it, and usually contemporaneous events. Timelines can use any suitable scale representing time, suiting the subject and data; many use a linear scale, in which a unit of distance is equal to a set amount of time. This timescale is dependent on the events in the timeline. A timeline of evolution can be over millions of years, whereas a timeline for the day of the September 11 attacks can take place over minutes, and that of an explosion over milliseconds. While many timelines use a linear timescale—especially where very large or small timespans are relevant -- logarithmic timelines entail a logarithmic scale of time; some \"hurry up and wait\" chronologies are depicted with zoom lens metaphors. == History == Time and space (particularly the line) are intertwined concepts in human thought. The line is ubiquitous in clocks in the form of a circle, time is spoken of in terms of length, intervals, a before and an after. The idea of orderly, segmented time is also represented in almanacs, calendars, charts, graphs, genealogical and evolutionary trees, where the line is central. Originally, chronological events were arranged in a mostly textual form. This took form in annals, like king lists. Alongside them, the table was used like in the Greek tables of Olympiads and Roman lists of consuls and triumphs. Annals had little narrative and noted what happened to people, making no distinction between natural and human actions. In Europe, from the 4th century, the dominant chronological notation was the table.

The scientists reinterpret ambiguous data, discard anomalous data, and try to stuff nature into the box of their shared paradigm—a theoretical matrix or fundamental view of nature—until compatible data become scarce, anomalies accumulate, and scientific \"crisis\" ensues. Newly training, some young scientists defect to revolutionary science, which, simultaneously explaining both the normal data and the anomalous data, resolves the crisis by setting a new \"exemplar\" that contradicts normal science. Kuhn explains that rival paradigms, having incompatible languages, are incommensurable. Trying to resolve conflict, scientists talk past each other, as even direct observations—for example, that the Sun is \"rising\"—get fundamentally conflicting interpretations. Some working scientists convert by a perspectival shift that—to their astonishment—snaps the new paradigm, suddenly obvious, into view. Others, never attaining such gestalt switch, remain holdouts, committed for life to the old paradigm. One by one, holdouts die. Thus, the new exemplar—the new, unwritten rulebook—settles in the new normal science.

The data from these experiments are not detailed in the book. Instead, he includes a list of alleged hits by John Edward that he describes as “dazzle shots.” ==Reception and analyses== There was initial positive reception upon release of the book and the results it detailed, primarily from the mediumship community and the media at large. Some noted the application of the scientific method to the unique subject of life after death. Others praised the experiments detailed in the book for their precision, detail, and the compelling nature of the results as presented. The accuracy rate of the mediums was often cited as 85% and above. Widespread critiques of Schwartz’s experimental methodology and analysis of results were noted in several subsequently published articles by, among others, Ray Hyman, Richard Wiseman, and James Randi. Prior to the conduction of the studies, the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) suggested a sufficiently rigorous experimental design to Schwartz that was believed would result in scientifically sound results. Schwartz did not utilize these designs in his experiments. In general, it was thought that the opportunity for mediums to implement cold reading techniques was ubiquitous, despite the design of the studies. More specifically, criticisms included: *Judging bias: Statements made by mediums generally vary in specificity and subjectivity, and are then judged subjectively by the sitters to be accurate or not.

Popper used astrology and psychoanalysis as examples of pseudoscience and Einstein's theory of relativity as an example of science. He subdivided nonscience into philosophical, mathematical, mythological, religious and metaphysical formulations on one hand, and pseudoscientific formulations on the other. Another example which shows the distinct need for a claim to be falsifiable was stated in Carl Sagan's publication The Demon-Haunted World when he discusses an invisible dragon that he has in his garage. The point is made that there is no physical test to refute the claim of the presence of this dragon. Whatever test one thinks can be devised, there is a reason why it does not apply to the invisible dragon, so one can never prove that the initial claim is wrong. Sagan concludes; \"Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all?\". He states that \"your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true\", once again explaining that even if such a claim were true, it would be outside the realm of scientific inquiry. ===Mertonian norms=== During 1942, Robert K. Merton identified a set of five \"norms\" which characterize real science. If any of the norms were violated, Merton considered the enterprise to be nonscience. These are not broadly accepted by the scientific community. His norms were: * Originality: The tests and research done must present something new to the scientific community. * Detachment: The scientists' reasons for practicing this science must be simply for the expansion of their knowledge.
